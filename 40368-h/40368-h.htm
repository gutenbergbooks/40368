<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>This is the fourth and last book of the
"Annapolis Series." It has been the purpose
of the author faithfully to portray the conditions
in which our midshipmen live at the
Naval Academy. The training given at Annapolis
is regulated by the needs of the Fleet,
and the Naval Academy in all of its departments
is entirely directed and controlled by
seagoing naval officers. After the Fleet's
world-encircling cruise, many of the officers
attached to it were sent to the Naval Academy
to instruct midshipmen in navigation and
electricity and gunnery and seamanship.</p>

<p>In the navy it is believed that the officer
who is fresh from drilling a twelve-inch turret
or a battery of broadside guns at record and
battle target practice, should be well qualified
to initiate midshipmen in the beginnings of
naval gunnery. It is for this reason that the
training at Annapolis reflects the needs of the
Fleet, and every officer on duty there has
either seen recent sea service or is looking forward
to an early sea assignment.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Stonewell and Robert Drake by name never
existed, but the same thoughts and ambitions
that animate them have animated many hundreds
of midshipmen; and incidents similar
to those described have happened countless
times. From this point of view these stories
are true stories. The names of their chief
characters may be found in no navy list, but
the truth of the Annapolis books does not depend
upon that. Stonewell and Robert Drake
have actually lived many times, and to-day
are living at Annapolis.</p>

<p>The author hopes he has presented in this
book and its three predecessors, "An Annapolis
Plebe," "An Annapolis Youngster,"
and "An Annapolis Second Classman," a fair
picture of the life of American midshipmen;
and not only of the naval atmosphere which
surrounds them, but of that inner life which
for the time dominates their relations to each
other and to the institution made famous as
the alma mater of many names illustrious in
naval history.</p>

<h2>An Annapolis First Classman</h2>
<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">GLASSFELL, DRAKE AND STONEWELL</p>


<p>"Hello, Stone! Hello, Bob! By George,
but I'm glad to see you!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Glass, you old sinner, I can just
imagine you've led those dear old aunts of
yours a lively life the last two weeks."</p>

<p>"You'll win, Stone, but you ought to get
them to tell you about it; ha, ha, ha! the dear
old ladies never dropped once."</p>

<p>Explosively enthusiastic greetings were exchanged
between three stalwart young men in
the Union Station, Chicago, on the twentieth
of September, of the year nineteen hundred
and something. Passers-by noticed them and
smiled, and in approving accents said, "College
boys!" All three were tall, broad-shouldered,
bronzed in face, and possessed a
lithesomeness of movement that betokened
health and strength.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Glassfell, Drake and Stonewell were midshipmen
on leave from the United States
Naval Academy. It was evident that they
had met in the Union Station by appointment.
Glassfell had just arrived from Wisconsin, and
Drake and Stonewell were to leave in two hours
for Annapolis.</p>

<p>"You two chaps are martyrs!" exclaimed
Glassfell; "here you are giving up ten days of
glorious leave just to go and train for the football
team. Now here I am, cheer leader, head
yeller, or whatever you call me, far more important
than either of you, you'll admit, and
I'm not due at Annapolis until October first."</p>

<p>"'Daily News,' last edition," droned a newsboy
near by.</p>

<p>"Don't bother me, boy; Chicago news
doesn't interest me. Some new sandbagging
on Wabash Avenue, I suppose, and nothing
else. Get out."</p>

<p>"A fine cruise, wasn't it, Glass?" remarked
Robert Drake. "By George! I'd had some
troubles on my previous cruises, but this went
like clockwork; not a single thing happened
to worry me, and I certainly had troubles
enough on my plebe and youngster cruises."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"You did indeed, Bob," remarked Stonewell,
"but you'll have to admit you were fortunate
in the wind up. Now Glass, here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Daily News,' last edition," was shouted
close to their ears.</p>

<p>"Stuff that boy. Put a corn-cob down his
throat," said Glassfell with an amused glance
at the persistent newsboy. "Say, fellows,
wasn't that a good one I worked on old
'I mean to say'? Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Which one, Glass?" asked Robert Drake.</p>

<p>"Oh, the best one, the time I hoisted up two
red balls to the masthead when he was on watch
in charge of the deck, during drill period. And
didn't the captain give him the mischief?"</p>

<p>An outburst of wild hilarious laughter
greeted this reminiscence, as evidently a very
humorous episode was recalled. In seagoing
language two red balls means that the ship
carrying them is not under control; and at
the time referred to by Glassfell the red balls
had no business to be hoisted, and their presence
brought down upon Lieutenant-Commander
Gettem, nicknamed "I mean to say"
by the midshipmen, a wrathful reprimand
from his captain.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was pretty good, Glass," laughed
Stonewell, "but you had to own up, and got
sanded well for it."</p>

<p>"'Daily News,' last edition!" screamed a
voice interrupting the midshipmen.</p>

<p>"Look here, boy, how many papers have
you to sell?" inquired Glassfell.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five, boss; here's yours, and only
one cent."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll buy your twenty-five
papers and give you twenty-five cents besides
if you'll make a hundred yard dash for the
outside. Give me your papers; here's fifty
cents."</p>

<p>"I'm your man, boss," cried the newsboy,
handing over his papers, grabbing the fifty-cent
piece and making a tremendous bolt toward
the exit.</p>

<p>"He's afraid of a recall," laughed Robert.
"Say, Glass, are you going to start a wholesale
newspaper business?"</p>

<p>"Let's see what the news of the day is,"
replied Glassfell, unfolding one of the papers
and laying the others down on a seat.</p>

<p>"Here's an alderman up for graft; a bank
cashier has gone wrong; hello! My heavens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
here's a naval war-ship goes to the bottom with
all on board."</p>

<p>"What ship? what ship?" simultaneously
cried out Stonewell and Robert, in affrighted
tones.</p>

<p>"The submarine boat 'Holland'! Ha, ha,
ha, I got you both that time, didn't I? You
chaps will nab any bait that comes along."</p>

<p>All three laughed heartily. "You're an
incorrigible wretch," smiled Robert; "I shudder
at the idea of spending another year with
you at the Academy." But the friendly hug
that accompanied these words left no doubt of
the affection Robert bore to the jovial Glassfell.</p>

<p>"By George, fellows, here is an interesting
item, 'New cadet officers at the Naval&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"You don't sell me again to-day, Glass,"
grinned Robert. "You'll be giving yourself
five stripes and Stone a second class buzzard."</p>

<p>"Pick up a paper and read for yourself,"
cried out Glassfell excitedly. "Farnum gets
five stripes!" Glassfell read no further, but
with an expression of intense disgust threw
the paper down and stamped on it.</p>

<p>Stonewell and Robert were now eagerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
reading the paper. "Cadet Commander,
commanding the Brigade of Midshipmen,
Farnum," read Robert. "Cadet Lieutenant-Commanders,
commanding first and second
battalions, respectively, Stonewell and Sewall;
Cadet Lieutenant and Brigade Adjutant,
Ryerson. Cadet Lieutenant, commanding
first company, Blair&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A look of blank astonishment mingled with
disdain was to be seen on Robert's face.
"Well, Stone," he said, "the officers have done
it again, and I guess they can be relied upon
to make chumps of themselves as regularly as
they assign the brigade officers. You should
be our cadet commander, Stone, our five
striper; you know it, every midshipman in
the brigade knows it, the officers ought to know
it! You are number one man in the class,
the leader in Academy athletics, head and
shoulders above us all. And here they've
picked out a regular 'snide,' a sneak, and have
given him the place that belongs to you."
Robert spoke passionately; he was intensely
disappointed.</p>

<p>"You are entirely wrong about Farnum,
Bob," remarked Stonewell quietly; "he's a far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
better man than you give him credit for.
You don't understand Farnum; he'll do
credit to his five stripes. I'm entirely satisfied
with my four stripes; to be cadet
lieutenant-commander is as much as I have
any right to expect."</p>

<p>"You know why you don't get five stripes,
don't you?" asked Robert vehemently; "it's
because you took French leave a year ago,
and reported yourself for it! And didn't
Farnum jump ship at the same time? Only he
didn't get spotted for it. You reported yourself
for the purpose of explaining my deliberate
neglect of duty last year. You were
reduced to ranks as a result and Farnum was
then given your position as acting senior
cadet officer of the summer detail. If he'd
had any sense of fitness he would have reported
himself rather than have accepted it;
that was only a temporary affair, however,
and didn't amount to much; but because of
that same report it's outrageous that you
should be shoved out of the five stripes you've
earned by a man who was equally guilty, but
didn't have the manhood to report himself
when you did."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's rotten," remarked Glassfell. "Well,
Stone, old chap," he continued, "I'm sorry;
everybody will be; we all thought you had a
cinch on five stripes. But I wouldn't be in
Farnum's shoes; everybody will know he is a
fake. But as long as they didn't make Stonewell
cadet commander I'm rather surprised
they didn't give the job to me."</p>

<p>"Look here, Bob," said Stonewell, "I have
been hoping you would get three stripes&mdash;but
I'm sorry not to see you down for anything."</p>

<p>"That's too bad; isn't Bob down for anything?"
inquired Glassfell.</p>

<p>"Not even for a second class buzzard, the
lowest thing in cadet rank at the Naval
Academy," replied Stonewell.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear that," remarked Glassfell,
much concerned. "Bob ought to have
three stripes, anyway."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, fellows," said Robert,
cheerily, "I haven't expected a thing and am
not a bit disappointed. A midshipman cannot
live down a 'deliberate neglect of duty'
report in one year."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bob, I know, but I had hoped that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
your conduct at the fire a year ago and that
remarkable trip of yours last June would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Stone, please don't; you know that is
not to be talked about."</p>

<p>"Of course, but at the same time in spite of
that report you ought to get three stripes."</p>

<p>"That's right," commented Glassfell. "The
officers only see one side of a midshipman's
character; here I am, another martyr to their
ignorance; I'm one of the best men in the
class, the band master thinks so, and he's the
grandest thing I've ever seen at Annapolis;
and I'm a private in ranks for another year.
But perhaps this report isn't authentic; let's
see, the paper says that it is likely that these
recommendations will be made to the superintendent
by the commandant; the former is
away, will not arrive at Annapolis for two
days yet&mdash;hurrah, I may still get five stripes."</p>

<p>"Stone, I still hope you may command the
brigade of midshipmen our last year," said
Robert thoughtfully. "This newspaper account
does not pretend to be official; it says
'it has leaked out' that the commandant of
midshipmen's recommendation of the assignment
of cadet officers of the brigade will be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and so. Now the superintendent evidently
has not seen these recommendations, so they
are not as yet finally decided upon. Probably
this newspaper list is correct in the main, but
it is not final; the superintendent is away on
leave and has not yet acted; he has not even
seen the commandant's recommendations. If
either the superintendent or the commandant
were to know that Farnum had been guilty of
the same offense which is now to deprive you
of the five stripes you otherwise, by every
count, had earned, you would never be set
aside in favor of a man equally guilty but
not so square. It's shameful, that's what
it is."</p>

<p>Robert boiled over with angry thoughts.
Strong feelings dominated his expressive
features, and it was with difficulty that he
controlled himself. His classmate Stonewell
was at once his joy and pride, and he loved
him with brotherly affection. Stonewell in
his studies towered above all of his classmates;
he was the leader in athletics, captain
of the football team, and captain of the
Academy crew. He was class president and
his own class and all midshipmen confidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
expected he would be cadet commander in his
last year at the Naval Academy.</p>

<p>But Robert Drake more than wished for it.
Until this moment he had not realized how
he longed for it. In the preceding three
years at Annapolis Robert had had perhaps
more than his own share of troubles, and in
them all Stonewell had been to him a mountain
of strength and a deep well of affectionate
wisdom.</p>

<p>"Farnum for our five striper! Faugh!
The thought of it makes me sick! I'll not
stand for it," cried Robert.</p>

<p>"How can you help it, Bob?" queried
Glassfell, himself much disappointed, though
not nearly so vehement as Robert.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'm going to do," almost
shouted the latter; "Stone and I will be
in Annapolis the day after to-morrow, and
I'm going straight to the commandant and
convince him that he's made a big bust.
That's what I'm going to do!"</p>

<p>"No, you're not, Bob," said Stonewell,
quietly, yet determinedly; "you'll do nothing
of the kind. The commandant isn't
going to give me five stripes just because you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
want me to have them. You've had some
troubles at the Academy, partly due perhaps
to a sort of unrestrained impetuosity. Sometimes
you are apt to mix up in matters that
other people don't admit concern you. You'll
do me more harm than good if you're not
careful; and as a friend of mine I demand
you do nothing whatever about this matter."</p>

<p>Robert knew that Stonewell meant exactly
what he said, yet he could not give in at once.
"Look here, Stone," he doggedly maintained,
"some one ought to do this, and I'm
the man. Why don't you wish me to?"</p>

<p>"I've given you one good reason, Bob, and
I'll give you another. It wouldn't be fair to
Farnum."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair to Farnum!" ejaculated
Robert. "It wouldn't be fair to Farnum,"
he again repeated, in astonished accents.
"Will you please tell me why it would be
unfair to that sneak? How could it be unfair
to him for me to make a plain statement
of facts to the commandant, a statement that
would prevent Farnum from being put into a
high position which is utterly undeserved?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Bob; to begin with you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
made a mistake about Farnum; he's not at
all the poor character, the sneak, you think
him to be. You don't know him. You've
good reason to know how unfair it is to be
misunderstood. Your action would be particularly
unfair to Farnum because the first
thing he will do when he gets to Annapolis
will be to go to the commandant and tell him
just what you have said you intended doing."</p>

<p>"You've a better opinion of Farnum than
I have, Stone," rejoined Robert, shortly. "If
he does that I'll apologize to him. But if he
doesn't&mdash;well, he'll have a mighty uncomfortable
year, in spite of his five stripes, that's all
I've got to say."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">THE COMMANDANT OF MIDSHIPMEN</p>


<p>Drake and Stonewell reached Washington
the next morning, and the following morning
took a train bound for Annapolis. They
were ahead of the yearly rush of midshipmen
returning from September leave; members of
the Naval Academy football team are expected
to sacrifice part of their precious vacation in
order to commence football practice early.
Hardly were they aboard their train when a
tall, fine-looking young man, of perhaps
twenty-one or twenty-two years, approached
them. In his hurried glance at Robert and
Stonewell one might have seen an expression
of pleasure combined with uncertainty, the
pleasure when looking at Stonewell, the uncertainty
when his gaze rested momentarily
upon Robert.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Stonewell?" he said, in a
rather precise way, extending his hand to
him. "I'm glad to see you and Drake; have
you seen any others of the football squad?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, Farnum, how are you, old chap?
I'm real glad to see you," said Stonewell,
heartily. "No, I haven't seen any midshipmen
but you yet."</p>

<p>"How are you, Drake?" continued Farnum,
rather pointedly, and stood with hand outstretched
toward Drake. Apparently the latter
did not see Farnum's hand; he made no effort
to take it, but with his own right hand he
touched his hat and said: "Hello, Farnum."
Farnum's hand dropped to his side, and he
said impulsively, "Why won't you shake
hands with me, Drake? I would like to be
friendly with you, and I don't know why we
shouldn't be friends. Perhaps you are thinking
of the time when most of us misjudged
you, a matter that no one has more regretted
than I have."</p>

<p>"Farnum," said Robert, "you remember
our second class summer, don't you, when
I was reported for deliberate neglect of
duty?"</p>

<p>"Surely," answered Farnum.</p>

<p>"And you remember why I neglected my
duty? I was on as 'midshipman in charge
of floor' when you and Stone and Pete and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
some others were Frenching, and I left my
post so as not to have to report you all."</p>

<p>"I remember that very well indeed," rejoined
Farnum; "what of it?"</p>

<p>"Stone and the rest of them, except you,
reported themselves for the purpose of helping
me out, as much as they could, of the
trouble I was in. Stone was broken as acting
senior cadet officer, and you, guilty of the
same offense, were given his place. I hope
you enjoyed it." Robert spoke warmly.</p>

<p>"Look here, Drake, suppose you let me ask
you a few questions. When you left your
post that night was it to avoid reporting me?
Would you have deliberately neglected your
duty for me, or was it to benefit your own
particular chums, Stone, Pete and Glass?"</p>

<p>"I'd do more for them than for anybody
else at the Academy."</p>

<p>"Of course you would; I'd blame you if
you wouldn't. But you wouldn't have done
it for me alone, would you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I'd got sick of reporting
classmates. I hope I won't have to face that
question again."</p>

<p>"Drake, I wouldn't either have asked or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
expected you to do that for me. I didn't report
myself because you didn't do it for me;
I took my chance and was not reported. It
was all right for Stone to report himself if he
wanted to. As for being shoved into his position
as acting senior cadet officer, that didn't
amount to a hill of beans, and you know
it. It was a very temporary matter, and it
didn't make any difference to Stone or me or
you or anybody else. At the same time I
don't mind saying that I was sorry at the
time I supplanted Stone. I'm also sorry you
have seen fit to brood over this matter. I
suppose I can get along without your friendship,
though I was perfectly sincere in offering
you mine."</p>

<p>"Do you know who's going to have five
stripes?" asked Robert sharply.</p>

<p>"Why Stone, of course&mdash;I haven't seen
the stripe list yet, but I don't imagine anybody
else will be considered for that job."</p>

<p>Without saying anything more, Robert
took a newspaper clipping from his pocket and
handed it to Farnum. Stonewell, who had
been silent during the talk between his two
classmates, now said, offering his hand to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
latter, "I congratulate you, Farnum; I'm
sure you'll have a good brigade; you may
depend on my helping you to the best of my
ability."</p>

<p>Though Farnum was ordinarily a very self-contained
young man, his eyes bulged when
he saw himself gazetted as cadet commander.
He hesitated for a moment, seemingly lost in
perturbed thought; then turning to Stonewell,
he took his hand and said, "Stone, this is
very kind of you," and without another word
passed out of the car.</p>

<p>"Bob," said Stonewell rather sharply, "I
have a request to make of you, and if you are
the friend I take you to be you'll heed it. I
want you to drop this matter of five stripes.
You'll make a nuisance of yourself and will
make me ridiculous. I want you to promise
me you will not go around and tell people
Farnum shouldn't have five stripes and that
I should."</p>

<p>"Stone, I boil over every time I think
about it; I can't help it. It just makes me
mad to see Farnum smirking and grinning,
and usurping the place that belongs to you.
But I don't think he'll enjoy his job, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in his heart that everybody knows he's an
impostor. The idea of his saying to you 'this
is very kind of you.' I'm disgusted!"</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, don't think about him, and as
you feel so strongly try to avoid talking about
the matter. Let's talk of something else.
The entire squad should arrive by to-morrow,
and we ought to get in some good
practice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Stonewell received a violent interruption.
A sudden lurch of the train threw a
passing youth right on top of the two midshipmen.
The young man immediately recovered
himself and then broke out into a
hearty peal of laughter. "I beg your pardon,
I'd no idea I was so clumsy. You chaps are
going to Annapolis, aren't you? So am I.
I'm a midshipman." The speaker seemed to
take it for granted that he was both important
and interesting. He was full of apparent
good nature and friendliness and wanted to
talk; he was about nineteen years old, and
was tall and strongly built. A great shock
of tawny yellow hair surmounted a rather
handsome, freckled, healthy face. He had a
thick neck and his shoulders were heavy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
His appearance betokened great good nature,
and there were health, strength and quickness
in every movement.</p>

<p>"You don't look like a midshipman," said
Robert shortly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the young man with a laugh,
"I've only been one for twenty days; I was
sworn in September first, and then got leave,
a grandmother died and the estate had to be
settled&mdash;ha, ha, ha,&mdash;any excuse would have
done&mdash;but I'm going to go back to-day for
football. I know something about the game,
and expect to make the team from the start.
My name is Henry Bligh. What are yours?"</p>

<p>"Young man," said Stonewell, in forbidding
tones, "after you've been a midshipman
for a while you will notice that other midshipmen
are a bit slow in proclaiming who
they are to strangers in public places. You
are excused."</p>

<p>A blank expression spread itself over Mr.
Bligh's face. He looked from Stonewell to
Robert. Neither took any further notice of
him, and in a hesitating way he walked to
the rear of the car.</p>

<p>"A bit fresh, isn't he, Stone?" smiled Robert.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Bob; like you and I were when we
first came here, and like most midshipmen
are at first. He's a well-built plebe, and looks
like good football material. Well, here's old
Annapolis once more&mdash;what a pleasure it is to
get back to the old town."</p>

<p>The train slowed down and stopped and the
passengers impatiently crowded to the door,
anxious to be off.</p>

<p>"Hello," exclaimed Robert, "Farnum must
be in a hurry; he's taken a carriage; I'm
glad I'm not in a hurry, for I'm busted, as
usual."</p>

<p>Farnum had jumped into a carriage and
gave directions to be driven to Bancroft Hall;
on his arrival there he went immediately to
the commandant.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you, Mr. Farnum," said
the commandant, greeting him warmly. "I
suppose you've come back early for football
practice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Farnum paused for a moment
and then began abruptly, "Captain, I have
here a list of midshipmen which it is said
you are to recommend as cadet officers. I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>slated, according to this list, to be cadet commander.
I wish permission to speak to you
frankly about this."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Mr. Farnum. Those are the
recommendations I shall submit to the superintendent
within an hour. The list was not
made public by me; it leaked out somehow;
but I guess no harm has been done. But it
will not be final until the superintendent approves
it. He has just returned from leave,
and so has not acted upon it."</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me frankly why I am
recommended to be cadet commander, and
Mr. Stonewell is not?"</p>

<p>"This is unusual, Mr. Farnum, but as you
are recommended for the highest cadet rank
I don't mind being perfectly frank. Mr.
Stonewell is number one in your class, and
in pretty nearly everything at the Academy.
The summer cruise officers and the ordnance
and seamanship and discipline officers have recommended
that he be made cadet commander;
and you were recommended pretty nearly
unanimously to be the senior cadet lieutenant-commander.
But last summer Mr. Stonewell
committed a most serious breach of Academy
regulations. He took French leave one night."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that the only reason he doesn't get five
stripes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, yes."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, I must report I was also guilty,
at the same time, of the same offense. Mr.
Stonewell and all the others of the party,
except myself, reported themselves for being
absent, for the purpose of helping Mr. Drake.
I didn't at the time feel called upon to do so,
though I have since keenly wished I had.
You can see, sir, it will be impossible for me
to hold five stripes with any degree of self-respect.
My classmates know all the circumstances.
I would feel that I was an impostor
and my classmates would have contempt for
me. I could never have the respect nor exert
the moral authority that should go with five
stripes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Farnum, I'm entirely surprised. You
should have reported yourself last summer."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but as I didn't do so then I must
now."</p>

<p>"Of course; however questionable your notions
of last summer were your present action
is commendable. Well, Mr. Farnum, you will
hardly get five stripes, but, I assure you, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
have my entire respect. Good-morning, sir,"
and Farnum was bowed out.</p>

<p>"By George," reflected the commandant,
"that young man has a sense of duty; he's
pointed right. I shouldn't wonder but what
it would be a good thing to call in the leading
midshipmen of a class before cadet officers
are assigned and talk it over with them.
Well, I think the best thing I can do about
this list is to recommend Stonewell for the
brigade commander and Farnum for command
of the first battalion. They will simply
shift places and the other recommendations
will not be disturbed."</p>

<p>After making this change in the list the
commandant left his office and was soon with
the superintendent, Rear-Admiral Wentworth.
After a cordial greeting and some preliminary
talk the commandant, Commander Dalton,
said: "Admiral, the most pressing thing I
have is to get your approval for the assignment
of the cadet officers. I have the recommendations
here; I am entirely satisfied we'll
have the brigade of midshipmen well officered
this year."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p><p>"Let me have your list," said the superintendent,
reaching out for it. "I see you have
recommended Mr. Stonewell for cadet commander.
Hum. I had almost decided to put
another young man in that position, but I
think I'll let that stand. Farnum and Sewall
are to be the cadet lieutenant-commanders.
Well, let that go. Ryerson, senior cadet lieutenant;
he'll make an ideal brigade adjutant.
Pass him; but where does my young friend
come in?"</p>

<p>"Who is he, admiral? What's his name?"
queried Commander Dalton.</p>

<p>The superintendent did not reply, but read
the list over hurriedly, and then said, impatiently,
"Why, Dalton, his name doesn't
figure here at all, but I can fix that easily; he
goes in right after Ryerson, and will be cadet
lieutenant, commanding the first company of
midshipmen."</p>

<p>The admiral seized a pen, interpolated a name
between Ryerson and Blair, and then signed
the roster of cadet officers. He handed this to
the commandant, saying, "Dalton, Mr. Drake
will command the first company; shove everybody
after him on your list down a peg."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p><p>"Why, admiral," remonstrated the commandant,
"Mr. Drake isn't entitled to this; it
is true he was unanimously recommended by
all but the discipline officers to be cadet
lieutenant, but he most deliberately neglected
his duty when he was a second classman
when on a special detail. He is a very attractive
young man, but we cannot forget such a
serious blot as that."</p>

<p>The superintendent smiled. "Dalton," he
said, "I was here on duty twenty-five years
ago, when I was a lieutenant, in the department
of seamanship."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I well remember your being here,
for I was at that time here also, as a midshipman."</p>

<p>"Well, one year I was among those detailed
to make the recommendation for new
cadet officers. There was one midshipman,
high in his class, a splendid fellow, that would
have had high cadet office except he was constantly
kicking over the regulations. He was
the leader of every mad excursion that occurred
within these walls; his exuberance of
spirits brought him continual trouble. So
when we came to make our recommendations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>we pursed our lips and passed over the midshipman
I'm speaking of. We made a mistake
I've regretted ever since. Well, that
midshipman became an officer that the whole
navy ever since has been proud of, and when
I was ordered here as superintendent I asked
the Navy Department to send him here as
commandant. By the way, his name is
Dalton."</p>

<p>Commander Dalton became very red in the
face, and then in a husky voice much affected
said, "Admiral, I'd no idea you had this
opinion of me&mdash;I can't express my feelings;
you have touched them deeply. I am glad
Mr. Drake is to be cadet lieutenant. I'll have
the list copied and published this afternoon."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">A HAPPY SURPRISE</p>


<p>Robert and Stonewell spent the first day of
their return in getting settled and in seeing
the football coaches and talking about the
football material of the new fourth class. A
number of the regular players had already returned,
and the afternoon train brought in
about twenty midshipmen who had been in
the squad the previous year, all of whom were
now eager to commence practice.</p>

<p>"We'll start in to-morrow, fellows, good
and hard," said Stonewell; "be on the field at
eight in the morning; we'll get the whole
fourth class out later, after they've finished
their morning drill, and we'll size up and
pick out the likely ones and give them a tryout.
Come on, Bob, let's go to quarters.
Come along with us, Farnum, if you're walking
that way."</p>

<p>The three walked toward Bancroft Hall together.
"What do you think of the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
class, Stone?" asked Farnum. "Are there
any good men in it?"</p>

<p>"There are indeed, I should say, from just
looking at them, but we will know better to-morrow,
after we've given them a try on the
field. There's a plebe named Bligh who has
told me he expects to make the team."</p>

<p>Farnum laughed. "He told me the same
thing. I hope he'll make good; if he does
we'll pardon his freshness. What do you
hear of West Point? No midshipman now at
Annapolis has ever seen the Academy beat
West Point at football. George! I do hope
we'll win; we ought to, we have twice as many
men here as there are at West Point."</p>

<p>"It would seem so. And yet when we had
many less midshipmen than there were cadets
at West Point we used to beat them right along,
and since we have had more West Point has
beaten us. You can depend on one thing,
both academies will have strong teams this
year and both will make strenuous efforts in
the great battle to be fought in Philadelphia
next fall. I hope you'll make the team this
year, Farnum; you tried hard enough last
year," added Stonewell kindly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll get it if desperate work on my part
will bring it to me."</p>

<p>Neither Farnum nor Robert addressed remarks
directly to one another, and after a
while the three midshipmen had reached the
steps leading to Bancroft Hall.</p>

<p>"Let's see if there are any new orders
posted," suggested Robert, and the three
young men directed their steps toward the
bulletin-board. In an instant Robert set up
a great shout. "Hooray," he cried, "Stonewell
has five stripes." Robert had looked no
further than the head of the list and was wild
with unexpected happiness. Then he suddenly
grabbed Farnum by the arm and said:
"Stone told me that I wasn't fair to you; that
you were a better man than I took you to be;
that the first thing you would do when you
got to Annapolis would be to go to the commandant
and report yourself for that affair of
last summer. Did you do that?"</p>

<p>Farnum looked pleased. "Yes, Drake, I
did, but it makes me feel mighty good that
Stone thought well enough of me to predict that
I would. I'd rather have that confidence on
his part than five stripes, any day of the week."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Farnum, I'm not as wise as old Stone; I
apologize to you for my unkind judgment and
for not taking your hand in the train. I hope
you will forgive me and accept my friendship,"
and a warm handclasp and a happy reconciliation
followed.</p>

<p>"Why don't you chaps read the rest of this
list, and see who the remaining cadet officers
are?" asked Stonewell.</p>

<p>"They're just the same as in the list we saw
published, aren't they?" queried Robert.</p>

<p>"Well, Farnum gets the first battalion&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good, I'm delighted," burst out Robert.</p>

<p>"They've a good man commanding the first
company, haven't they?" continued Stonewell.</p>

<p>"Yes, Blair is one of the best men in the
class; he'll make a splendid three striper;
he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't Blair; take a look for yourself,
Bob."</p>

<p>Robert glanced at the written order assigning
the brigade officers.</p>

<p>"Drake, cadet lieutenant, commanding first
company."</p>

<p>Robert's heart commenced to thump, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
blood rushed to his head and he felt a surging
of happiness within that seemed almost overwhelming.
He was like a thirsty man in a
desert unexpectedly finding water. Until
this moment he had never known how much
cadet rank meant to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Stonewell," he cried, "I can't believe
it; isn't it likely to be a mistake?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. The superintendent's
name is signed to it. This is better news
to me than the five stripes, even," rejoined
Stonewell. "Bob, I'm pleased beyond expression."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted, Bob," cried Farnum.</p>

<p>It was indeed a happy trio that congratulated
each other and tried to realize their
good fortune.</p>

<p>"Come on, Bob," said the practical Stonewell
at last, "let's go to our room and
straighten it up a bit. Will you come along,
Farnum?"</p>

<p>"No, I've my own room to fix up. Bob,
old chap, you're my senior three striper, and
I'm ever so glad of it," and Farnum's expressive
eyes confirmed this feeling.</p>

<p>Once in their room Robert was in no hurry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to do anything but talk. Boisterous jubilance
exuded from his every movement and every
expression. "Stone, the first company is going
to win the flag this year," he suddenly exclaimed.
"We're going to have the best
drilled, the best all around company of the
brigade. Just keep your eye on the first company
this year, old fellow."</p>

<p>"Bully for you, Bob, I believe you'll win
it," replied Stonewell. "Now I wonder," he
continued with a laugh, "if you have already
decided which pretty girl you will ask to present
the flag to your company after you have
won it."</p>

<p>Robert's face reddened, and then he said,
smiling happily, "We'll talk about that
later."</p>

<p>The young men now busied themselves in
unpacking their trunks and stowing their
clothes in their wardrobes, placing aside their
civilian clothing to be sent to the basement.
After this was finished they commenced to
talk. "This is a fine room, Stone," commented
Robert. "Here, out of this window,
is Chesapeake Bay, and from the other we can
look over at the Armory across the lawns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
into the city of Annapolis. I tell you, it's
worth while to room with the five striper.
And it's worth while to be a five striper, too.
You can visit during study hours, you can
come and go as you please; no officer would
ever think of questioning the cadet commander.
You'll have a good brigade, Stone;
discipline here depends pretty much on the
cadet officers, and every one of us will do his
level best that your brigade shall be the best
of our time."</p>

<p>"That's right, Bob, we'll all do our best.
We'll try to make every man feel that what
he does is important. If all the units are
earnest the grand result is bound to be satisfactory."</p>

<p>"Stone, you and I are the best of friends,
aren't we?"</p>

<p>"That's been my idea, Bob, for several
years."</p>

<p>"Well, I've been thinking it's surprising
that in spite of our intimate friendship I
should know so little of your family; you
know all about mine."</p>

<p>"Why, Bob, what's put that into your
head. You've been to my home in Chicago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and have met my people&mdash;and they think
everything of you."</p>

<p>"Well, it just came over me that you never
speak of them. Do you remember three
years ago, at about this time, how you
Frenched from the 'Santee' and how I followed
you out into Annapolis, and how Captain
Blunt caught us and reported us?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed; pretty hard luck, wasn't it?
Say, Captain Blunt is a fine fellow, isn't he?
I've just read that his ship, the 'New Orleans,'
now on the Asiatic station, is to come
home in a few months. I trust his hopeful
son will not be bilged by that time; that
young man is in constant danger of getting
into trouble." Stonewell picked up his cap
and continued, "I'm going down the corridor;
I'll be back in a little while."</p>

<p>"Hold on, Stone, I want to talk about that
time we Frenched. Now I've never asked
you any particulars; you told me you had to
go out to see a brother who was in some terrible
trouble, and you've never said a word
about him since&mdash;and I've never asked you.
Now can't you tell me something about him,
Stone? It isn't mere idle curiosity, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
are so much in my thoughts that I can't help
but be interested in your brother. Is he like
you?"</p>

<p>Stonewell sat down, saying: "Bob, you
were very good to me at that time and were
most considerate then and have been ever
since in not asking questions. I went out
that night to see my brother Frank. Frank
is entirely unlike me in character, though
people say we resemble one another very
much in appearance; from his earliest boyhood
he has constantly been getting into
scrapes, and some of these have been serious.
He is wild and impulsive. Frank wouldn't
intentionally do a low or a wrong thing, but
has done some crazy acts which have resulted
badly.</p>

<p>"Now, the day I Frenched, when you followed
me, I had received word that Frank
had passed a forged check, and the same day
I learned he was hiding in Annapolis; I was
beside myself. You see I didn't know but
what if it was true. Well, it came out all right.
Frank hadn't passed a bad check, but an
older man with whom he spent much time
had, and Frank's name was brought in. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was badly scared; he was only sixteen at the
time, and he came here to me. You see there
was no real occasion for his being scared and
coming here or for my being so upset. But I
didn't know how bad it was and I was nearly
crazy until the next morning, when I received
word that everything was all right. Still, it
isn't a very pleasant recollection, and I have
never felt inclined to talk about it. Now,
Bob, I think I've answered your question.
Do you want to know anything more about
Frank?"</p>

<p>"Yes, where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He's a sophomore at Princeton," returned
Stonewell.</p>

<p>"Well, you are the greatest fellow, Stone;
if I had a brother at Princeton I couldn't
help but talk about it; all my friends here
would know it."</p>

<p>Stonewell smiled. "Come on, Bob," he
said, picking up his cap again. "Let's go out
and see what fellows have come back. The
entire squad should be here by this time."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">ACADEMY LIFE BEGINS</p>


<p>The next morning the returned football
squad were all out on the athletic field, and
everybody was busy with preliminary practice
in passing, kicking, tackling the dummy
and running with the ball. At eleven o'clock
the entire fourth class were assembled on the
field. Each one of these three hundred young
men was looked at and questioned as to previous
football experience, and about forty of
them were advised to come out for practice.
Of these forty, ten appeared to be likely candidates
and were told to find football uniforms,
and to practice for the time being with
the squad. The most promising of these ten
was Bligh, and this promise did not suffer
from excessive modesty on the part of Mr.
Bligh.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I can play football&mdash;a little," he
said, with a smile that intended to convey the
idea that "the little" was in reality a great
deal.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where have you played?" asked Stonewell.</p>

<p>"Oh, two years on the University of Minnesota's
team, and before that at St. Paul High
School," drawled Mr. Bligh.</p>

<p>"What have you played?"</p>

<p>"Quarter, half and end. Look up the 'St.
Paul Pioneer Press's' All Northwestern team
for last year; I guess you'll find they know
who I am out there, mister."</p>

<p>"We'll give you a chance to show what you
can do, Mr. Henry Bligh. Now take a ball
and punt for a while."</p>

<p>It wasn't long before Stonewell said: "That
fellow knows football; he's a find. We need a
good quarter and will try him for it. You can
see by the way he handles the ball that he's
an old hand at it. But I don't like his manners,
though we'll forget that if he plays good
football. He's a good deal of a brag."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Drake," said a pleasant
voice behind Robert. The latter turned
around and then enthusiastically cried:</p>

<p>"Hello, Sexton, I'm glad to see you back. I
hope you'll make it a go this time. Why
have you those togs on?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going to try for the squad," replied
Sexton.</p>

<p>"Look here, Sexton, take my advice and
don't go into football; math comes hard to
you, and football takes up a lot of time on one
hand and tires you out; makes it hard to
study, on the other. Now you don't want to
bilge again, and you don't want to take up
anything that will interfere with your studies."
Sexton had failed in his studies and had been
dropped from the Academy in consequence
the previous year.</p>

<p>"I want to play," replied Sexton, "and if I
get low in my studies and it is known I play
football the instructors will help me out; will
give me easy subjects and high marks."</p>

<p>"Not unless you're a star player. You'd
better give it up, Sexton. Hello, Blunt,"
Robert continued to another young man who
just came up, "so you're out for football, too,
are you?"</p>

<p>"You bet, and I'm going to make quarter
on the first team, too. Last year's quarter
graduated in June, and I'm the boy to take
his place."</p>

<p>"Do you see that plebe over there, kicking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the ball?" interrupted Stonewell, who, while
watching different players, had half listened to
the talk going on about him.</p>

<p>"That fellow with a thick bunch of hair,
that one who has just kicked?"</p>

<p>"Yes, watch him a bit. He knows the
game; he has played quarter on Minnesota's
team. You'll have to get up and dust to beat
that fellow out of quarter-back."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm going to let a plebe
beat me?" cried out Third Classman Blunt, indignantly.
"I'll stand him on his head.
I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blunt, leave the football field immediately
and turn in your clothes," interposed Stonewell,
sharply. "I'll be in my room at half-past
seven to-night if you care to discuss with
me your future conduct on the football field."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stonewell, I'm not going off the field.
I didn't mean anything&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" stammered
the dismayed Blunt.</p>

<p>"Is your delay in obeying my order due to
ignorance or insubordination?" demanded
Stonewell severely. Blunt had been somewhat
insolent in his manner to Stonewell, and
was being disciplined on the spot.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Without another word Harry Blunt turned
and slowly left the field.</p>

<p>"Stone, aren't you a little hard on him?"
asked Robert.</p>

<p>"Purposely so, Bob; it's the only kind of
treatment he understands. He's an irrepressible
youngster, well meaning, but it's best in
dealing with him to temper justice with
cruelty. He'll be around to-night in a contrite
spirit with sincere promises to be good,
and to-morrow he'll be on the field again and
he'll play for all that's in him. He'll be wild
to beat that plebe, and this lesson will be good
for him."</p>

<p>Blunt did as Stonewell predicted he would,
and was out on the field next day. Two
teams were formed and at the end of each
day's practice these were lined up against each
other and a fierce scrimmage occurred. Robert
Drake was put at right end of the first team;
opposing him was Farnum. Stonewell played
left tackle; Bligh was quarter-back of the first
team, Blunt quarter of the second. These
positions were subject to constant change, and
many midshipmen were tried in different
positions. A common spirit animated them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
First a winning team must be developed, and
a winning team meant but one thing; it meant
West Point's defeat. After that each player
was anxious either to hold his own place on
the first team or by superior playing on the
second team to earn a place on the first.
Bligh sprang into immediate popularity because
he played well from the start. Harry
Blunt did not have Bligh's previous experience,
but gave promise of developing into a good
quarter-back.</p>

<p>Robert Drake found Farnum a formidable
opponent. The latter played with an impetuosity
and spirit that took no heed of
possible injury, and before October first he
was regularly playing on the first team, much
to his satisfaction. The midshipmen of the
football squad by October first had had much
exercise and were pretty well hardened;
most of them were old players, and in the
first real game, against Lehigh, the Naval
Academy team played with a dash and spirit
that delighted the hearts of hundreds of midshipmen
on the bleachers as well as scores of
officers.</p>

<p>By this time everybody, midshipmen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
officers, had returned from leave, and in a
day Academy life had settled down to its
regular routine. One day was allowed the
midshipmen to get ready for the year's work,
and the next day midshipmen were marching
to recitations and drills with monotonous
regularity.</p>

<p>The first formation of the brigade was a
thrilling moment to Robert Drake. The
warning bugle blew and eight hundred midshipmen
scampered to their places in ranks,
laughing and talking, some in desperate
efforts to "beat the bugle." With the last
blast of that unmusical instrument came
complete quiet; then in front of each of the
twelve companies into which the midshipmen
were divided was to be seen a young man
rapidly calling his company roll; and as
names were called vociferous "heres" were
to be heard coming from all parts of the long
line of midshipmen; when the midshipman
in front of the first company on the extreme
right had finished calling his roll, he came
to an about face, and saluted an impassive
midshipman, his company commander, Cadet
Lieutenant Drake.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"First company, three absent, sir," reported
First Petty Officer Peters.</p>

<p>"Take your post, sir," ordered his captain,
Cadet Lieutenant Drake. First Petty Officer
Peters smartly stepped off to the right of the
company, Cadet Lieutenant Drake at the
same time going to the company's left.
Down the line could be heard shouts of
different company officers, aligning their
companies. And then the midshipmen of
the first company heard a ringing order, not
too loud, but in a tone that before the end of
the year became entirely familiar to them and
in which each man learned to have entire
trust.</p>

<p>"First company, left step, march. Company
halt. Left dress. Back in the centre,
up on the right, carry it along, back extreme
right. Steady. Front." Each of the twelve
companies had been similarly aligned by its
cadet lieutenant, and the brigade, stretching
along the terrace for over five hundred feet,
was now as straight as a taut string.</p>

<p>In front of the brigade, facing it, all alone,
stood a tall, erect, manly-looking midshipman,
entirely self-possessed, apparently not carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
away by the distinguished position he occupied.
Triumphant feeling must have had
a place in his heart, but of this there was no
external evidence.</p>

<p>Such formations as these occur innumerable
times in the midshipmen's career; they are
held before every meal, before every drill, and
on many other occasions; and each time every
midshipman at the Academy is accounted for.</p>

<p>Six hundred and sixty-five permanent
regulations, besides special orders, control the
lives and actions of each of the eight hundred
midshipmen at our national Naval School.
There are many officers on duty there for
instruction purposes, and a few have special
disciplinary duties concerned with the inspection
and regulation of the conduct of the
midshipmen. But it is only by the effective
coöperation of the cadet officers that discipline
is maintained. The commandant inspects
the midshipmen and their quarters Sunday
morning; the lieutenant-commander on duty
for the day as "officer-in-charge" makes
several inspections during his twenty-four
hours' time; but the cadet officers have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>multifarious disciplinary duties over midshipmen
in their control, and as stated, it is
the efficient execution of these duties by the
cadet officers and the carrying out by them
of the commandant's and officer-in-charge's
orders, that largely controls the actions and
conduct of individual midshipmen.</p>

<p>Robert Drake realized all this; what midshipman
does not who has been at the Naval
Academy for three years? And now came to
him, as comes to all cadet officers, a determination
to do his part with all the ability
he possessed. He was indeed happy to be
cadet lieutenant, and was proud of the three
stripes on each sleeve that indicated that rank.
As cadet lieutenant he had many daily routine
inspections and reports to make and was assisted
in these by two cadet officers, a cadet
junior lieutenant and a cadet ensign, and by
eight petty officers, a number of the latter
being second classmen.</p>

<p>"Well, Stone," Robert remarked as they
commenced their studies, "I certainly have a
busy eight months cut out for me. Just look
at these formidable lessons assigned us for to-morrow.
Here are twenty pages in seamanship,
and about the same amount in gunnery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and in electricity. We've got an awful lot to
do this year in steam engineering, and look at
those five hundred pages in navigation.
Whew! I don't see how we're going to do it
well. Then I'm sure to be constantly busy
with my company duties; this ought to be
enough, but on top of this is an hour and a
half's drill each day, and after that, football
till it is too dark to see. Jimmini! If we
get more than a smattering out of those books
I'll be surprised. And you'll be busy too;
you're editor of the 'Lucky Bag'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and chairman
of the hop committee!"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Each year the senior class publishes a book called "The Lucky
Bag," which is illustrative of midshipman life.</p></div>

<p>"Yes, we'll have no spare minutes," replied
Stonewell. "Let's get to work."</p>

<p>The next morning, as the gunnery recitation
commenced, the instructor, Lieutenant
Clement, said: "Gentlemen, your theoretical
book work has been all planned, and by looking
through your ordnance and gunnery books
you can see just what it will be. For practical
work during winter drill periods we will
take torpedo mechanisms apart and put them
together, and we'll go aboard the monitor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>'Nevada' and study her turret and her guns.
In the last of May a crew of first classmen
from each company will go out into the bay
and will fire at a regulation target with the
'Nevada's' six-pounder guns under the
regular target practice conditions. Each company
six-pounder crew may practice as much
as it can find time to with the six-pounder
gun in the armory gun shed. The head of
the department instructs me to tell you that
you are encouraged to make any devices or
innovations so long as the gun is in no way
disabled, though any suggested change must
be submitted to him before firing the gun.
The record made in gun-firing is entirely competitive.
The crew making the best record
will do a good deal toward winning the flag
for the company it belongs to; a poor record
will certainly defeat any such chance. Now
we will proceed to our day's lesson in ballistics.
Mr. Drake, take the first problem."</p>

<p>The drill assigned to the first company that
afternoon was infantry. The drill call sounded
after the last study period was over, and by
four o'clock Robert was marching his company
across lawns to the drill grounds. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
marched them in columns of squads, changing
to company front, and felt very important
indeed in his position as company commander.
Upon arrival at the drill grounds he ordered:</p>

<p>"Company&mdash;halt! Unfix bayonets. Stand
at ease." Then, sheathing his sword he said:
"Fellows, since I've been at the Academy the
first company has always been among the best
companies of the brigade. I want it to keep
its reputation as such this year, and I'm sure
you'll all have the same desire. The company
had the honor of carrying the brigade colors a
year ago, but it lost it last June by a narrow
margin. You all know the company that has
the best record for the year wins the flag, and
carries it for the next year. The record is
made up of many things, excellence in the
various drills, excellence in the different forms
of athletics, target practice, boat sailing, sharp-shooting,
etc. Any man that does well individually
in anything adds to his company's
multiple and helps just that much. I'm going
to do the very best I can to help win the flag
for the first company. I take it for granted
every one of you is with me and each will do
his best for the same purpose. And we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
be certain that each of the other eleven companies
will do its utmost to win the colors."
Bob paused.</p>

<p>"Company attention! Shoulder arms!
Rear rank, fourth file, last squad, step to the
front."</p>

<p>A diminutive midshipman, seemingly hardly
five feet tall, but fat, happy and careless looking,
assisted by some vehement whispered advice
of the left guide, shambled awkwardly to
the front of the company, with his rifle on his
right shoulder.</p>

<p>"That chap over there said you meant me,
mister," said the small midshipman, in an engaging
manner.</p>

<p>"Salute," ordered Cadet Lieutenant Drake,
severely.</p>

<p>"Certainly, mister," replied the young man,
eagerly taking off his cap and bowing.</p>

<p>"Put on that cap. Don't you know the rifle
salute? Have you had any drill? What's
your name?"</p>

<p>"Reginald Mumma. These chaps call me
Mama's Darling, mister; I wish you'd have
it stopped."</p>

<p>"When did you enter the Academy?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"A month ago, but I've been sick in the
hospital; just got out yesterday."</p>

<p>"Third petty officer, fall out of line of file
closers. Drill Mr. Mumma as a recruit every
day this week, and whenever the company
has infantry, till he can take his place in
ranks. Squads right, full step, march."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">A MYSTERIOUS CRY</p>


<p>The football season opened auspiciously for
Annapolis. About fifty midshipmen were
members of the football squad; these were
excused from drills except on two afternoons
of the week. Of those selected to play in
regular games all were seasoned players, and
except Bligh, all had played on the Naval
Academy team the previous year. And so
Stonewell and Robert and others were quite
hopeful.</p>

<p>The head coach was Professor Danton, the
field coach Gates, a famous old Yale player.</p>

<p>After several hard games on successive
Wednesdays and Saturdays Stonewell was
called into special consultation by Danton
and Gates.</p>

<p>"Stonewell," began Gates, "I've been watching
our team, and I'm convinced we have a
fine lot of men here; not only good football<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
players but real trustworthy chaps, men who
will keep their promise, whose word can be
depended upon."</p>

<p>"We don't want any other kind," replied
Stonewell, thinking by Gates' manner that
there was something in the wind.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to size up each man's
character," continued Gates, "and I've decided
to put personal trust in every one of
them. But I will exact an individual promise
of secrecy from every member of the squad
for something I'm going to give them. The
matter is this: I have devised a forward pass
which if it isn't expected and is properly executed
is practically certain to bring a touch-down
to the team that works it. I've sent it
to Yale, where it has been tried out in secret
practice, and the people there are wild over
it. I've told them I wanted to give it to the
midshipmen. They don't like that idea, but
it's my own play, and I can do so if I wish
to. They've asked me, if I give it to the
midshipmen, to take every precaution for
secrecy and not to use it until after Yale
plays Harvard. Annapolis plays West Point
the same day that Yale meets Harvard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
you could work the trick against the soldiers.
It's a beauty. Now what do you say, Stonewell?"</p>

<p>"We will most certainly agree to secrecy,"
replied Stonewell, much impressed. "I will
get the individual promise you require from
every member of the squad to observe entire
secrecy about this play, and we'll never practice
it except in secret practice and will never
play it in a game until we meet West Point.
Is that what you require?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll give it to you. We'll suppose
our men have come down the field and are
within an easy place-kick of the goal; we'll
then make all preparations apparently for a
goal from the field, and turn the play into a
forward pass. We'll station our men as follows&mdash;&mdash;"
and a lot of technical football talk
followed.</p>

<p>Stonewell was delighted. "By George," he
said, "that's great! We'll work that on
Franklin Field, and we'll certainly make the
'Army blue.' We'll try it to-morrow afternoon.
I'll let only the first team know of it
and get your required promise from them,
and we'll work it on the unsuspecting second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
team; we'll have everybody, officers and all,
kept away."</p>

<p>"Secret practice" for the football squad
was ordered for the next day; at the beginning
of the practice the first and second teams
were ordered at first to keep in different parts
of the field.</p>

<p>"What's up?" queried Harry Blunt, the
ambitious quarter-back of the second team, to
a group of players about him. "One would
think the Only Stonewell had something up
his sleeve. Come along, fellows; if we keep
up our work of yesterday this team will be
the first team before long."</p>

<p>After half an hour's practice the two teams
were called together for a scrimmage. Bucking
the line, running around the ends and
punting were employed until the ball was
fifteen yards from the second team's goal and
in the possession of the first team. Then
quarter-back Bligh gave the regular signal for
a goal from the field. The second team knew,
of course, the first team's signals, but it did
not know that an apparent stumbling in the
numbers he called out was a signal that the
Gates forward pass was now to be played.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The first team players took their places for
a goal from the field, Stonewell, as usual,
dropping back, and before the second team
players knew what had happened Robert
Drake was sitting on the ball between the
goal posts.</p>

<p>Everybody was crazy with delight. One
would have imagined West Point had been
scored upon. The play had worked perfectly.
The squad was now all gathered together and
was talked to by Gates and Stonewell; it was
evident that Gates was well satisfied that his
confidence in the midshipmen was not misplaced.</p>

<p>In the next few weeks this play was repeatedly
practiced, and Gates was satisfied
that if the midshipmen had the opportunity
they would play it successfully on the day of
the great West Point game.</p>

<p>It was Stonewell's purpose to develop the
team as a whole, not individual star players.
As right end Robert became famous among
midshipmen for getting down the field
promptly under kicks, and for tackling and
downing in his tracks the opposing player
who caught the ball. The two finds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
season were Bligh and Farnum. The former
knew the game and played with intelligent
skill. As quarter-back his position was most
important and at different critical moments
he ran the team with unerring judgment.</p>

<p>Farnum played with desperate valor. His
tackling was fierce, and in running with the
ball and interfering when one of his own side
had it he took every chance. His impetuosity
brought him into prominence as a sure ground
gainer. In close places the ball was generally
given to Stonewell. There was something
peculiarly invigorating in Stonewell's personality.
When his signal was made there was
a penetrating intensity that affected every
Annapolis player. The danger was in working
him too much.</p>

<p>One Saturday early in November, Annapolis
was matched against Bucknell. Bucknell
had always been a formidable antagonist of
the midshipmen; the year previous it had
defeated them. Up to now Annapolis had
not lost a game, and the midshipmen were
particularly anxious to defeat Bucknell, which
on this occasion had brought a stalwart lot of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>players. They were strong, heavy, and confident.
Before the game Stonewell called Farnum
aside and said: "Now, old chap, be a
little careful of yourself. You are bound to
get badly hurt at the rate you are going, and
we want you to save yourself for the West
Point game. You're going to be given the
ball a good deal to-day; Bob Drake is a bit
stale, and my knee is bothering me. Now
look out for yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll try to remember, Stone," was the reply;
"but when I get started I'm not apt to
think of anything but the game. But I'll
try to be careful."</p>

<p>Bucknell kicked off and Drake caught the
ball. He was down the field with a tremendous
start, dodging one player, smashing by
another, making twenty-five yards before he
was downed.</p>

<p>Bligh believed in quick action. The Annapolis
team was lined up immediately and
in a second the ball was in play. Farnum
banged through the line between guard and
tackle, making over fifteen yards for Annapolis.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Farnum," cautioned Stonewell.
In an instant Farnum had the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
again and was around the end and speeding
for Bucknell's goal. Ten yards before he got
there he was brought to earth with terrific
violence, and he lay there still and limp.</p>

<p>On the side lines, leading the cheering,
Glassfell was executing all kinds of crazy
antics; the midshipmen on the bleachers, full
of joy, shouted themselves hoarse. But poor
Farnum lay there unheeded, entirely unconscious.
And in vain did the appreciative
midshipmen shout: "Farnum! Farnum!
Farnum!" for that young man was carried off
the field on a stretcher without regaining
consciousness.</p>

<p>Two more plays, Stonewell carrying the
ball, brought a touch-down to Annapolis and
Stonewell kicked a goal. This was the only
scoring done during the game. In vain did
each team hurl itself against the other; all
for nothing did prodigies of violence occur.
When time was finally called the score stood
Annapolis 6, Bucknell 0.</p>

<p>And then thoughts turned to Farnum, now
in the Academy sick quarters. When questioned
Surgeon Pickron looked grave and
said, "Mr. Farnum has had a terrible blow
on the head&mdash;he has had many recurring
spasms ever since&mdash;I regard his condition as
very serious."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">
<img src="images/i001.png" width="486" height="700" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>AROUND THE END</i></span></span>
</div>

<p>Such news travels fast, and on Saturday
night the whole Academy, officers and midshipmen,
were much perturbed. Sunday
brought no change for the better and Surgeon
Pickron advised an operation. Farnum had
not regained consciousness. Surgeon Welton,
who was in command of the hospital, insisted
on delaying, against Dr. Pickron's advice,
and on Monday morning everybody was
much cheered up by hearing that Farnum's
spasms had ceased and that he had come to
himself. It was decided not to perform the
operation, though Dr. Pickron believed that
a clot of blood had formed and that Farnum's
skull should be trephined.</p>

<p>From now on Farnum continued to improve
and in two weeks he was discharged
from sick quarters and sent back to Bancroft
Hall, though it was ordered that he was to
play no more football. But it was not the
same Farnum. In place of the cheery, wideawake
youth who had battled so valiantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>against Bucknell, was a slow-moving, hesitating
young man. He seemed afraid. The
slightest unexpected noise or untoward incident
seemed to startle him, sometimes to
frighten him badly. "I can't help it, Bob,"
he said one time, with half a laugh and half
a sob; "it's my nerves, I suppose; I'm sure
there's something wrong with me; I know
I'm acting like a baby, and I guess it will
pass after a while; but I can't help it, I can't
help it," and then Farnum broke down.</p>

<p>Stonewell, Robert and some of the others
had long talks with him. They were all
drawn to him and were much concerned.
One of Farnum's peculiarities was that he
didn't dare to go out at night. The entire
first class were now devoted to him. His
popularity had come late in his midshipman
career, but it was now strong and abiding.
And his sufferings were so acute and so constant
that he had the warm sympathy of all.</p>

<p>And Academy life went on apace, and
Academy life at this period of the year is
mostly concerned with football. True, there
are study hours and recitations; long hard
lessons must be read over and officers must
hear recitations; formations must be attended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
drills undergone, and examinations prepared
for. This football spirit infected the officers
as it did midshipmen. Football was the one
topic of conversation, the one purpose in life
during this epoch, and those that didn't play
shouted vociferous advice, admonition and
encouragement from the bleachers.</p>

<p>One Friday night in the middle of November,
at five minutes before ten, the bugles in
Bancroft Hall rang out their customary discordant
warnings that all midshipmen were
to repair to their rooms immediately. In five
minutes the midshipmen were to be in bed
and all lights out. And instantly hundreds
of midshipmen rushed through the corridors
to get to their own rooms; for they are given
the time from nine-thirty, the end of their
study period, to ten for visiting.</p>

<p>On this Friday night the midshipmen
ran to their rooms as usual at the warning
signal. Until the last minute of the allowed
time there was to be heard the scurrying of
hurried feet resounding through the corridors
and a babble of shouting and laughter. Eight
hundred midshipmen seemed to have something
to say that couldn't keep till the morrow.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten o'clock came, and with it complete
silence save for the measured tread of cadet
officers going from room to room to see the
occupants thereof were all in bed. And now
sounded forth the clock, with its ominous tick-tock,
as though it had been silent all day, and
there came the oppressive silence which reigns
each night after ten o'clock. So it was this
Friday night. Four bells, indicating ten
o'clock, were struck, the lights were put out
and a solemn hush was upon the eight
hundred occupants of Bancroft Hall.</p>

<p>And then, in the stillness of the night, there
arose an awful heart-terrifying shriek. It was
plainly in the armory wing and evidently
from one of the upper floors. Startled, affrighted
midshipmen jumped from their beds
and stood in listening attitudes. Again came
a cry that permeated every nook and corner
of the armory wing, and hundreds of midshipmen
listening with painful intensity
plainly heard the words:</p>

<p>"Help, help, Stonewell, help; I'm going
down, going down, down." The tones were
those of one in fearful agony. The midshipmen
jumped to the doors of their rooms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
into the corridors, all with unspeakable dread
in their hearts, waiting for a leader to direct
their actions.</p>

<p>Stonewell, rooming on the first floor, dashed
into the corridor, followed by Drake.</p>

<p>"Where's that cry?" he demanded in
strident tones.</p>

<p>"The top floor, sir," cried little Mr. Mumma,
with trembling voice. Up the stairway
bounded Stonewell and Robert.</p>

<p>Hardly had this occurred when the cry was
again heard. It seemed now to be in the
corridor of the third floor, which by this time
Stonewell had reached. Stonewell stood perplexed
and worried; in a second the fearful
scream was again heard, but now evidently
from the floor below, the second floor. Stonewell
ran to the stairway at one end of the
corridor, followed by the other midshipman.
"Where is that cry?" he again demanded of
the startled midshipmen standing about, much
bewildered.</p>

<p>"It was here a minute ago, right here, right
here," replied Harry Blunt. "But what's the
matter? what's happened?" he asked. Again
they were silenced by the awful cry: "Help,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
help, Stonewell, save me!" which arose from
the floor below. It was twice repeated, each
time seeming farther away, and then it ceased
entirely. By this time Stonewell and Robert
had run down two flights to the ground floor.
Midshipmen here had heard the frightful
shrieks and many scared faces were to be
seen.</p>

<p>"Turn out, everybody; get into ranks.
Company officers, muster your companies,"
shouted Stonewell. "Pass the word to the
upper floors, Bob," he called out. "Muster on
the first and ground floors," and Robert was off
in a flash.</p>

<p>"You have anticipated my orders, Mr.
Stonewell," remarked the officer-in-charge.
"Make a careful muster; we'll investigate;
what do you think it was?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine, sir; I'm entirely bewildered;
the cry was undoubtedly heard at
the top of the building, and it was heard later
on each floor. I followed it down from the
third floor. But nobody came down on the
stairways, I'm certain of that, and the cry
seemed near the centre of each floor, where
no stairway leads down. If it wasn't that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
believe everything on earth is explainable I
would say it is uncanny."</p>

<p>While Stonewell and the officer-in-charge
were talking Bancroft Hall had burst into life.
The cries had ceased.</p>

<p>In going along the ground floor Stonewell
came across Bligh, half supporting Farnum.
The latter was shivering with unconcealed
fright.</p>

<p>"What is it, Stonewell?" he half whispered.
"Oh, what has happened? Hasn't something
dreadful occurred?"</p>

<p>Farnum had the appearance of a sick man.
He was agitated in manner, and seemed weak
and trembled; without Bligh's assistance he
would have fallen.</p>

<p>"Just a joke, old chap," replied Stonewell
kindly; "nothing to worry about; but you're
sick, I can see that. Man, you have a raging
fever!"</p>

<p>"Get to your company, Bligh; I'll take
care of Farnum."</p>

<p>Stonewell reported Farnum as being sick,
and received permission to take him to sick
quarters, at some distance from Bancroft Hall.</p>

<p>The result of the muster was that Bligh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Farnum were reported as not being present
but the absence of both was explained, Farnum
being sick and Bligh being with him when the
latter's company was mustered.</p>

<p>The midshipmen, tremendously interested
and impressed, were now waiting to be dismissed.
All sorts of conjectures were ventured
to explain the mystery, and some had superstitious
fears in their hearts. Mr. Henry
Bligh listened with a queer expression to a
great many theories of this remarkable episode,
but offered none himself. But after he
was dismissed he chuckled and laughed, being
apparently much pleased with something.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">THE GATES FORWARD PASS</p>


<p>The commandant was inclined to make little
of the incident of that Friday night.
"Just a midshipman's joke," he said next
morning to the officer-in-charge.</p>

<p>"I don't feel that way at all," replied that
officer. "I don't believe anybody could have
simulated the horror of those tones. I confess
I have no theory about the matter and I'm
at an utter loss in attempting to account for
the way the cry descended from the upper to
the lower floor, for it certainly did do that.
It couldn't have been anybody running downstairs,
for the midshipmen in charge of floors
were at their desks at the foot of the stairways,
and they say that nobody except Mr. Stonewell
and Mr. Drake came down, and it wasn't
either of them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll tell you how it was done," said
Commander Dalton. "Some jokers got some
rubber hose in some way and fixed up a plant
to bewilder the officer-in-charge. I can imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
sections of hose were led to the different floors
and were triced up overhead and acted as
speaking tubes. You didn't think to look
overhead, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't, but I don't think that could
be the explanation."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but some joking midshipman
was at the bottom of it. If it happens again
just look overhead."</p>

<p>For several days following Stonewell appeared
much preoccupied and was to be seen
wandering about the corridors in the central
part of the armory wing. Facing the corridors
were long lines of midshipmen's rooms;
the only communication between the floors
were the stairways, two to each floor. Finally
Stonewell went to the top floor and after looking
about, disappeared into a small doorway
leading to the tower, where the ventilating
blower was in operation. This was on Wednesday
afternoon just after study hours were
over. At this time Robert Drake was standing
by the stairway of the ground floor, leading
to the basement. Harry Blunt came by
and said: "Hello, Drake, come along, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>you're going to football practice to-day; Stonewell
said he wanted us on the field as early as
we could get there."</p>

<p>"I'm just waiting for Stone; he's gone up to
the fourth floor, and said he would be down
directly."</p>

<p>Then to Robert's great surprise, Stonewell
came up the stairway from the basement.</p>

<p>"How in the world did you get into the
basement?" he exclaimed. "I saw you start
for the top of the building and you came out
of the bottom. How did you do it?"</p>

<p>"I'll let you know later, Bob," Stonewell
said quietly, and Robert knew he didn't care
to talk before Blunt. "Come along, fellows."</p>

<p>They started off at a brisk pace; near sick
quarters, Stonewell said: "I'm going to drop
in to see Farnum; an operation was performed
on him Saturday afternoon, and Dr. Pickron
said I might see him to-day. He is getting
along finely."</p>

<p>"That's splendid news," exclaimed Robert;
"just tell him how sorry we all are that he
has been sick."</p>

<p>"May I see Mr. Farnum for a few minutes?"
asked Stonewell of Dr. Pickron, in
sick quarters.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, top floor back on the right. Don't
stay too long with him."</p>

<p>"Thank you, doctor, I'll only be with him
a moment."</p>

<p>Stonewell found Farnum lying in bed with
his head bandaged. "Hello, Stone," cried
the latter happily, as Stonewell came in, in a
different tone of voice than Farnum had had
for some weeks. "By George, Stone, I'm
feeling a lot better; I've got rid of that miserable
feeling I had for such a long time. Dr.
Pickron is all right; he cut my head open
and I'm going to be well and out in ten days
or two weeks. I knew there was something
wrong with me, but Dr. Pickron has fixed it
all right. I'd been in bad shape ever since
that Bucknell game."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted, old fellow," replied Stonewell
enthusiastically; "that was a hard bump
you got that day, but you're looking ever so
much better. Everybody will be awfully glad
to hear you are getting along so nicely; the
squad, particularly."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll play no more football this
year."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that, Farnum. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
played a slashing game, and had much to do
in getting that six against Bucknell; but you
played too hard, as I was afraid you would.
Say, old chap, you were pretty sick the night
I brought you over here, weren't you? Do
you remember much about it?"</p>

<p>"I've been worrying about that, Stone; I remember
coming over with you, but I'm a
good deal bewildered as to what happened before
I saw you. I'd been feeling sick all day
and turned in early. I went to sleep and had
a horrible nightmare; I hate to think about
it."</p>

<p>"Where were you when you woke up?"</p>

<p>"That's what has been bothering me.
Stone, I found myself in the basement. How
in the world I got there, what I was doing, I
have no idea. I woke up with the most awful
feeling of terror a man ever had, and I didn't
know where I was. If it hadn't been that
young Bligh was down there I'd have lost my
grip; I didn't have much of one as it was.
Bligh saw I was in bad shape, and grabbed me
and half carried me to the floor above."</p>

<p>"What was Bligh doing there at that
time?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like to say, Stone; you must remember
he did me a good turn."</p>

<p>"Well, I know what he was doing, he was
breaking training; I suspected that; I detected
the odor of tobacco on him that night,
and I've had this same notion before. If I
learn that he's breaking training I'll fire him
off the team. Do you know, Farnum, I've
heard you were seen going up on the fourth
floor a little before ten that night. Have you
any recollection at all of that, any dream even?"</p>

<p>"None except a most horrible dream; I
shudder to think about it. Say, Stone, I
hope you won't talk about this; I'd hate to
have the notion get among the fellows that I
had been crazy."</p>

<p>"I won't speak of it, old chap, to anybody;
but I can tell by your very appearance you're
going to have no more trouble. Say, our next
game is with the University of Virginia, and
after that we play Harvard; by George, I
hope we make a good showing. Good-bye,
old chap; I'll drop in to see you every day or
so until you're back with us."</p>

<p>On his way out Stonewell stopped in to see
Dr. Pickron. "Doctor," he said, "Farnum is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
doing well. What was the operation you performed?"</p>

<p>"We trephined his skull. He received a
hard blow on the right side of his head in
the Bucknell game; this caused a rupture
and resulted in a hemorrhage or blood clot,
which was formed between the membranes of
the brain and the skull; and there was a
slight depression of the skull over this area.
I wanted to operate at the time he was first
hurt, but the blood clot was mostly absorbed,
and apparently Mr. Farnum regained his
normal condition. But actually there remained
a thickening of the membrane over
this area, and this, with the slight depression
of the skull, caused a constant pressure. This
resulted in a certain form of epilepsy, which
was his condition when you brought him over
last Friday night."</p>

<p>"Doctor, while in this condition could
Mr. Farnum have walked about, unaware
of what he was doing, as if he were asleep,
and later know nothing about what had
happened?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; it's quite likely that very
thing happened to Mr. Farnum."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you very much, doctor," and
Stonewell left and went to the athletic field,
where football practice had already commenced.</p>

<p>"Bligh," called out Stonewell sharply, "I
believe you've been breaking training. I give
you fair warning that if you are caught
at it you'll be kicked off the team without
ceremony."</p>

<p>Bligh looked uncomfortable and commenced
to bluster. "Who says I've broken training;
just let me know who it is! Don't I play
quarter well enough for you, Mister Stonewell?"
he continued sneeringly.</p>

<p>"Blunt can take your place any time," replied
Stonewell shortly. "He's playing better
every day, and your playing is at a standstill.
Now get busy."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're one of the mighty Stonewell's
pets," muttered Bligh to Harry Blunt.
"Your bootlicking begins to draw interest."</p>

<p>This uncalled for and unexpected insult was
too much for Harry Blunt's uncertain temper;
full of rage he jumped at Bligh and struck
him heavily in the face. The two lads
clinched, but were immediately separated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Harry's face aflame with angry indignation,
and Bligh furious with mortification. Stonewell
called them sternly to time, threatening
summarily to dismiss both from the team if
they didn't bury their personal differences:
nor would he listen to any explanation from
either.</p>

<p>"Shut up, both of you, and get to work,"
he ordered peremptorily.</p>

<p>After this the rivalry between Bligh and
Blunt became bitter. Blunt secretly was
tremendously encouraged by Stonewell's remark
that he could take Bligh's place any
time. In the next game, against the University
of Virginia, Blunt was put in at
quarter, and won golden opinions. Virginia
was beaten 10 to 0, and there were many that
now openly said: "Blunt is every bit as
good as Bligh, and with another season's experience
he will be better."</p>

<p>Bligh was aware of this sentiment, and it
exasperated his already bitter feeling against
his rival; he had much enjoyed the reputation
of being the Naval Academy's best
quarter-back. He showed this bitterness by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>a sullen behavior that was evident to everybody
and which brought down upon him
severe criticism and reprimand. But he did
not change.</p>

<p>On the next Wednesday, Annapolis was
matched against Harvard. The wearers of
the crimson came to the field smiling and confident,
but it wasn't long before they commenced
to look worried. Annapolis immediately
commenced to tear great holes for
steady gains through the Harvard line. To
the enthusiastic midshipmen on the bleachers
it seemed like a regular walk down the field.
When ten yards from Harvard's goal, Lumsden,
a second classman, took the ball. No one
knew just how it happened, but the ball
slipped from Lumsden's grasp, and quick as
a flash the Harvard captain emerged from the
scuffle with the ball under his arm and an apparently
clear field before him. Robert Drake
downed him on the Annapolis fifteen yard line.</p>

<p>Harvard now tried rushing tactics, but to
her dismay could make no headway, and on
the third down kicked a goal from the field.
From now on Annapolis played with wild
desperation. Chances looked bright for them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>but without realizing it the team was exhausting
itself. Toward the close of the second
half Annapolis had the ball seventeen yards
from the Harvard goal line, and now Stonewell
realized, too late, that his men were exhausted,
that Harvard had better staying
powers. Twice Stonewell threw the entire
strength of his team against Harvard, but the
latter stood the shock easily. The midshipmen
were worn out. And then on the third down,
Stonewell whispered to Bligh, the quarter-back,
to try a goal from the field. "Our best
and only hope is to tie the score," he said.</p>

<p>Once more the two teams were lined up,
Annapolis bracing itself for a final effort,
Harvard doggedly determined. And then
Bligh gave the signal.</p>

<p>"Thirteen, twenty-one, ninety-seven, forty-six."</p>

<p>"Time, time," called Stonewell, suddenly,
running out and holding up his hand.
"Blunt, oh, Blunt!" he shouted to the side
lines.</p>

<p>"Get off the field, you hound," Stonewell
said in tones of contempt to Bligh.</p>

<p>The latter had given the signal for the
Gates forward pass.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">THE WEST POINT GAME</p>


<p>In another moment, but for Stonewell's
quick action, the ball might have been put in
play.</p>

<p>All the Naval Academy players instantly
realized what Bligh had intended, and every
one was intensely angry.</p>

<p>Gates, who had heard the signal, came running
out on the field from the side lines; the
Harvard players were tremendously surprised
and did not know what to make of the commotion
among the midshipmen, and the
umpire was angrily ordering the midshipmen
to play and Gates to get off the field. Short
shrift was given to Bligh; the latter's attempted
expostulation was cut short, and
Stonewell passionately ordered him away.
Blunt took his place as quarter. A place-kick
was attempted, but was blocked, and time was
soon called. The game ended with the score
Harvard 3, Annapolis 0.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The midshipmen players ran to their dressing
rooms, and much hot and angry talk followed.
Some were for reporting Bligh and
having him dismissed. Others were for giving
him a physical beating; others proposed
that he be put into complete "coventry."</p>

<p>"None of this will do, fellows," said Stonewell,
after listening to a lot of angry proposals
for Mr. Bligh's discomfiture. "Not one of
us here will ever speak to the man; that goes
as a matter of course; but we must be very
careful to avoid doing anything that will tend
to create discussion. Bligh's leaving the field
was not understood by anybody but our own
players. If he be put in 'coventry' or thrashed
or reported or disciplined for what he did to-day
the matter might leak out. West Point
scouts were present watching our play, and
Harvard plays Yale soon. The only thing to
do is to keep absolutely mum; in this case
the ends of justice and of discipline must give
way to football necessities. We must keep
faith with our friends of Yale."</p>

<p>"But is such a hound to be permitted to remain
a midshipman?" burst out Harry Blunt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>"I've been brought up to believe a midshipman
could not do a dishonorable thing and
remain a midshipman; is Bligh to do a
scoundrelly act and not only go unpunished
but also to have the secret of it kept by us
who would have been disgraced if he had succeeded
in his purpose?"</p>

<p>"Just so, Blunt," replied Stonewell.
"There's nothing else to do. Should we report
Bligh it is quite possible the whole
thing would come out, and Gates' forward
pass from a fake kick formation would become
a matter of common knowledge. We
may win the West Point game through it.
Yale plays Harvard the same day we play
West Point. Each of us must avoid doing a
thing in regard to Bligh that will cause comment
or discussion. His leaving the field at
that time and his being put off the squad is
bound to cause talk in the brigade. If anybody
asks why, just say he didn't suit, and
change the subject."</p>

<p>"That's right," broke in Professor Danton,
who had been an interested listener, "but I
just want to add one thing; in the many
years I've been here, there have been at different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>times bad characters entered as midshipmen;
but they're invariably found out
and dismissed. Mark my words, Mr. Bligh
will be no exception&mdash;he's undoubtedly a dishonorable
character&mdash;don't worry about him;
he'll not last a year here."</p>

<p>Much discontented grumbling followed, but
all realized there was nothing to do except
follow Stonewell's directions. As a natural
result impotent rage was felt by the midshipmen
players against Bligh. In spite of Bligh's
dastardly act they were to be powerless to
show their contempt for him or their resentment
of his conduct, nor could the midshipmen
of the brigade be told until after the
football season had ended.</p>

<p>"And just think of the brigade giving
Bligh the 'four N yell,' fellows, as he left the
field," grumbled Harry Blunt.</p>

<p>The members of the team talked of Bligh's
conduct rather than of the game in which
they had just been defeated. Before the game
they had hardly dared to hope for victory
against Harvard, and all had now a satisfactory
feeling that a good battle had been
fought, and that no apology was necessary.</p>

<p>Amongst the midshipmen of Bancroft Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
much enthusiasm was felt for their team, but
great surprise was exhibited when at supper
Bligh was seen to go to his regular seat in
the mess hall instead of going to the training
table. It became instantly known that Bligh
was off the football squad, and "Why?" was
the question asked everywhere.</p>

<p>Bligh was very quiet, and in reply to numerous
questions said he could not talk about
the matter. Then all knew that he had been
dismissed from the squad.</p>

<p>"Pass the word, Pete," said Glassfell to
Peters, "that Stone says that no questions are
to be asked, and Bligh's leaving the football
squad is not to be talked about." It was wonderful
how loyally this mandate was observed.
It soon got to every midshipman of the brigade
and in spite of the intense curiosity that
existed every midshipman felt it a duty to the
team to carry out Stonewell's wishes.</p>

<p>That same Wednesday night, shortly before
half-past nine, Bligh appeared in the room
occupied by Stonewell and Robert Drake.</p>

<p>"By what authority are you visiting my
room in study hours?" demanded Stonewell
in coldly official tones.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"From the officer-in-charge, sir; I told him
it was most important."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>Bligh's reply came in halting, jerky sentences.</p>

<p>"I wish to explain that signal to-day, sir.
I was wild for our team to win; we could
have won by the play; I gave the signal without
thought, sir. It just sprang from my lips&mdash;I
never once thought about the promise&mdash;and
besides, it would be a greater honor to
win from Harvard than from West Point&mdash;and
probably we would have won by it from
West Point, too&mdash;we have never yet won from
Harvard. Don't you see, sir, I was working
for the Academy? I was carried away at the
time; it was a tremendous minute and the
desire to use a play that would win crowded
all other thoughts out of my mind; it's well
enough to think of promises when you have
time to do so; it's easy when you're sitting in
a chair doing nothing, but too much outside
matter should not be expected of the quarter-back
in the middle of a fierce game. I want
to go back on the squad."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh, from the very best possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
construction of your act, even if it were agreed
that your character is high, that with you a
promise intentionally broken is impossible,
your conduct has shown you to be irresponsible,
a person in whom trust cannot be reposed.
But from your words I judge you
regard a promise lightly&mdash;to be broken easily.
Your action was particularly bad because it
might have caused other men, who have
higher regard for their word than you have,
to be faithless to a promise. But I'm going
to make you one promise, and that is as long
as you are at the Naval Academy you will
never play football here again. You may
leave my room, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm going to stand this?"
cried Bligh, in passionate tones. "Do you
expect me to sit idle while you are ruining
my reputation? I'm not powerless, perhaps
I know of some way I may injure you&mdash;and
some others," and Bligh's eyes glared with
savage intelligence.</p>

<p>"I know what you're thinking of, you
miserable plebe. You're thinking you will
write to both West Point and Harvard about
the fake kick."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Bligh gave a violent start.</p>

<p>"But let me tell you," continued Stonewell,
"those people would spurn a correspondence
with you. If you attempt such a
thing as that I will learn of it, and then I'll
make you another promise; if you should do
it you'll be drummed out of this place to the
tune of the Rogue's March. Return to the
officer-in-charge, sir, and report you have
concluded your important matter."</p>

<p>Bligh turned and left the room. Angry
feelings dominated him. In his statements
to Stonewell he had unconsciously expressed
his sentiments; honor and truth were in fact
not salient characteristics of this young man,
and when giving the signal for the Gates forward
pass he had not given much thought to
the promise he and all of the team were
bound by. So he left Stonewell with a
sense of injury and resentment, not of remorse.</p>

<p>Stonewell and Robert lived in the corner
room of the ground floor, armory wing.
Bligh roomed with Sexton in the main corridor,
next door to the room used as an office
by the lieutenant-commander in charge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
first division of midshipmen, that officer occupying
the room only during the day.</p>

<p>When Bligh returned he found his roommate,
who had been off on some unauthorized
visiting since supper time, leaving the room
again with his arms full of clothes.</p>

<p>"What's up? Where are you taking those
things, Sexton?" inquired Bligh.</p>

<p>"I have permission to change my room;
I'm not going to room with you any
more."</p>

<p>Sexton was on the football squad, and so
knew of what Bligh had done. "So you're
against me too, are you?" shouted Bligh, now
beside himself with anger; he then left the
room and started down the corridor, and in a
moment saw Harry Blunt coming toward him.
He did not notice that Blunt, on seeing him,
suddenly clenched his hands and seemed to
breathe hard. In fact Harry's anger was yet
intensely alive, and the sight of Bligh set his
nerves on edge.</p>

<p>Bligh's overwrought feelings now left his
control; he wanted somebody to hate, and
because of his previous troubles with Blunt it
was very easy for him to vent his passion on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that young man. So as he passed Harry he
suddenly stopped and said:</p>

<p>"So the Great Stonewell's pet chicken has
bootlicked himself into quarter, has he?"</p>

<p>And then an avalanche struck Mr. Henry
Bligh. Before he thought of defending himself
a steam hammer blow slammed him
against the corridor wall and in the space of
three or four seconds blow after blow was
rained upon him; blows sent by Harry
Blunt, animated by intense personal animosity
and utter detestation. And then Bligh
dropped to the floor, covered his face with his
hands, acknowledging defeat, and groaning in
utter despair. To that overwrought fourth
classman it seemed as if the entire world had
combined against him.</p>

<p>Stonewell came running down the corridor.
"What does this mean?" he demanded
savagely of Blunt.</p>

<p>"He said I was your pet chicken, and had
bootlicked myself into quarter. I hit him; I
had to, I couldn't help it. I hadn't said a
word to him when he insulted me."</p>

<p>"Go to your room and keep away from
him. Get up, Bligh, and go to your room."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>After this episode Bligh was very quiet, and
kept much to himself. But whenever he
passed Harry Blunt or Stonewell a peculiar
expression crossed his face. One would have
said that though he never spoke of them yet
he thought much about them, and these
thoughts evidently were not pleasant ones.</p>

<p>The football season now drew to a close, and
finally those ancient friends but football
rivals, Annapolis and West Point, once more
faced each other on Franklin Field, in Philadelphia.
It is not the purpose here to depict
that glorious struggle; that is a matter of too
recent history and has been told many times.</p>

<p>The teams seemed about equally matched.
In the mighty rushing of one team against
the other neither side could make much, and
but few first downs were recorded; end runs
were nipped in the bud. All in vain would
one team hurl itself upon the other, and many
tremendous efforts accomplished nothing.
And so before the end of the first half kicking
tactics were adopted by both sides. Twice
when Annapolis had recovered the ball from
a punt down the field a place-kick was tried,
but each time it was blocked by West Point.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more, while there was yet ten minutes
to play, the midshipmen were within striking
distance of West Point's goal, and once more
Blunt gave the same signal for an attempt for
a goal from the field; a signal the West
Pointers now knew perfectly well. But they
did not appreciate a difference in Blunt's
manner of giving the signal, something well
understood by every midshipman player.
Stonewell fell back in his place, the midshipmen
braced themselves as usual, and
the West Pointers prepared to block the
kick.</p>

<p>On the bleachers the mighty host who had
been yelling themselves hoarse were momentarily
silent. Harry Blunt now grabbed
the snapped ball and then, with terrific force,
West Point plunged into the Annapolis line.
The shock was backed by all the strength and
pluck and spirit that the West Pointers possessed.
But bewilderment overtook them, for
something out of the usual had happened, and
in awful dismay they were like men groping
in the dark.</p>

<p>Blunt grabbed the ball when it was snapped
back and ran seven or eight yards to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
right; and at the same instant, with the
speed of a deer Robert Drake sped far over to
the right. He then turned and caught the
ball which with unerring skill Blunt had
thrown to the point where Robert was to
catch it.</p>

<p>In but a few seconds Robert was lying flat
on the ground between the goal posts. Annapolis
had made a touch-down. And now
from the Navy side there broke out prolonged
roars and shouts from fifteen thousand enthusiastic
Navy friends, while over on the
West Point side there was nothing but silent
dismay.</p>

<p>There was no more scoring, but all Annapolis
was wild with delight; for the first
time in four years she had defeated West
Point.</p>

<p>But on the midshipman stand, surrounded
by excited midshipmen in blue, there was one
young man who did not participate in the
general delight; for with brooding face and
troubled eyes Midshipman Henry Bligh sat
silent.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">"THE MAN WORE A SLOUCH HAT"</p>


<p>"Bang," went the reveille gun at six in the
morning, rattling every window in Bancroft
Hall; and out of bed jumped Robert Drake
in a hurry. He first took his customary cold
shower-bath, and then quickly threw on his
clothes. "Turn out, Stone," he called to his
roommate, who was in his own sleeping room
across the study. A suite for two midshipmen
consists of two sleeping rooms separated
by a longer room used in common by both, a
large clothes closet, and a shower-bath.</p>

<p>Hardly had the reverberating roar of the
morning gun died away than Bancroft Hall
was filled with the harsh, sleep-blasting notes
of discordant bugles.</p>

<p>"Turn out on this floor, turn out, turn
out," called out Robert in the corridor just
outside of his own room.</p>

<p>Then he entered the room next to his own,
in which Peters and Glassfell roomed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Bob," came from each sleeping
room which opened into the study room
where Robert had entered, and Robert left
and rushed into the next room. It must be
confessed that Robert was hardly out of the
room when Glassfell was once more sound
asleep. And further it is admitted that
Robert did not give the same stern inspection
to first classmen's rooms that he gave to those
of the lower classes. He was satisfied with
the report from his own classmates of "all
right," but saw with his own eyes that all
others were actually turned out. On this
particular morning Mr. Harry Blunt, midshipman
third class, was strangely very tired
after what should have been eight hours of
sleep, so tired, in fact, that neither gun-firing
nor bugle detonation awakened him.</p>

<p>"Turn out, Blunt, turn out," called out
Robert, standing over him. "Get up; you're
on the report for not being turned out at
reveille inspection."</p>

<p>Harry slowly turned out, and Robert rushed
away to continue his inspection.</p>

<p>Breakfast formation came half an hour later.
Most midshipmen were in ranks before roll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
call, but at the last note of the bugle swarms
of midshipmen rushed madly from Bancroft
Hall; midshipmen who had taken a few
winks after reveille inspection, hoping to get
to the formation without being marked late.
This was Glassfell's habit, and he had developed
remarkable skill in dressing himself
while running at full speed. He would leave
his room half dressed and at the end of a dead
run he would appear in ranks ready for inspection.</p>

<p>"By George, Stone," said Robert later, "can
you imagine there is anybody in the world
who does more mad rushing than midshipmen
do? We are jumped out of our sleep by a
cannon going off right under us, and we run
about in a feverish hurry all day long, always
having to be present at some formation or
other, always fearful of punishment if we are
late at anything. And one day is just like
another; we were jumped about all day long
when we were plebes, and we are still at it."</p>

<p>Every minute of Robert's life was interesting
and never had it been so full of zest as in
this, his last year at Annapolis. He enjoyed
his rank with its duties and authority as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
cadet lieutenant, also his studies and drills
were engrossing. These days, though so
crowded with detail, were much the same;
several hours daily were spent in preparing
lessons; recitations followed, and then at four
o'clock came the afternoon drills. The practical
drills supplemented the theoretical work
in class rooms, and all was based upon what
was to be required of the midshipmen after
graduation. And as an important duty of
graduated midshipmen is to teach and train
enlisted men, Robert, in common with the
rest of his classmates, was drilled at many different
things. He commanded his own company
at infantry and artillery man&oelig;uvres and
felt proud and important in this position, but
at other times he was to be found at a forge,
dirty with grime and sweat, or taking the place
of a fireman at a boiler. He could now turn
out a fair piece of work at the lathe, shaper,
or drill-press; and he was quite at home in
sailing a boat, running an engine or manipulating
a twelve-inch gun turret. For at Annapolis
drills are many and varied, and the
mind, eye and hand are all trained together.</p>

<p>December passed and with it football was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
forgotten. In the last of January came the
semi-annual examinations; of the first class
there now remained but one-half of those who
had originally entered.</p>

<p>In February occurred an incident of much
interest to Robert. At a Saturday night dance
he saw his first commander, Captain Blunt,
and with the latter was Miss Helen, his
daughter, and Harry Blunt's sister. It would
be hard to decide who was most pleased at this
meeting. Captain Blunt evinced real pleasure
in meeting Robert again, and Helen's welcome
was a genuinely glad one.</p>

<p>"Come and see us, Mr. Drake," said Captain
Blunt to Robert; "I've given up my command
and am on leave; I've brought Mrs.
Blunt and Helen to Annapolis. We've opened
our house here, as I'm going to be here for
several months and then go to the Light House
Board. Come and see us, and bring Mr.
Stonewell with you."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Midshipman Henry Bligh lived
a very quiet life. After the football game the
reason for his dismissal from the squad became
noised about, and Bligh felt he was ignored by
upper classmen and shunned by his own class.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
He probably thought more of this than did
anybody else and his thoughts were not happy.
Besides, he was low in his studies and in
danger of "bilging." He was barely satisfactory
at the semi-annual examinations.</p>

<p>One night early in February, after taps inspection,
and after the midshipmen in charge
of floors had been sent to their rooms, the
door of Bligh's room opened and that young
man's head cautiously appeared. Looking up
and down the corridor, and seeing the midshipmen
in charge were not at their desks, Bligh left
his room and walked to the end of the corridor
for a glass of water. This act was inoffensive
in itself, except that midshipmen are required
to attend to such matters before ten o'clock or
wait until after eleven; it was not yet eleven
and naturally Bligh did not wish to be seen.</p>

<p>While drinking the water Bligh heard some
steps on the stairway leading to the next upper
floor, and fearing it might be the officer-in-charge
he quickly slipped into a dark
corner at the side of the stairway, hoping he
would not be noticed; in a moment a figure
passed a few feet from him, and to his surprise
he saw it was Third Classman Blunt.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, what's that fellow up to?" reflected
Bligh, his mind full of the injuries he
imagined he had received from Harry Blunt.
Bligh peered around the corner and in the
dim light he saw Harry quickly and quietly
walk down the corridor and then stop for a
moment in front of the door of the room that
Bligh knew was the office of Lieutenant-Commander
Brooks, one of the discipline officers.
The next instant Harry had opened the door
of this room and entered it. Bligh was
astounded. He walked softly to the room,
paused an instant, and then gently, without
making any noise, turned the knob of the door.</p>

<p>The door was locked. Bligh was filled with
wonder. It was evident that Blunt had a key
to the door, had entered the room, and was
now inside.</p>

<p>Bligh could not imagine why any midshipman
should want to enter a discipline officer's
room; it was certain no midshipman had a
right to be in that office except to see Lieutenant-Commander
Brooks on duty. Blunt
was committing a serious offense in being in
the room. This did not worry Bligh at all,
but he was completely puzzled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"What can Blunt be doing in there?" he
asked himself again and again. He listened
intently and heard Blunt moving about; and
then he heard a noise as if a chair were being
moved and had knocked against something.
Looking up through the transom he saw it was
all dark within; Blunt had not turned on any
light.</p>

<p>Bligh now entered his own room, which was
next to the one that Blunt had entered, and
where Bligh now lived alone without a roommate.
With a puzzled mind he drew a chair
to his window, and thought and wondered.
His imagination could not help him. He had
been in the office next door and knew it contained
nothing but a desk, a table, two chairs
and a midshipman wardrobe where Lieutenant-Commander
Brooks could hang a coat if he
were so disposed.</p>

<p>Bligh sat by his window, his mind full of
Harry Blunt. The soft moonlight streamed
into his room. And then Bligh was startled
by hearing a noise in the room next door, as
if a window were being raised. Straining his
eyes he looked out from his window, and in
the next instant he saw the dark figure of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
man creep out on the passageway leading
from the window of the office to the terrace.</p>

<p>The man turned to his left, and with the
bright moonlight full on his face Bligh got a
good look at him, but did not recognize him.
The man wore a slouch hat, sack coat, and had
a moustache and full beard.</p>

<p>The dark figure stole over to the terrace and
soon disappeared.</p>

<p>"Now I understand," cried Bligh to himself.
"Blunt had an appointment with some
'cit' and they met in the room next door.
He's up to something, and I'll see that he gets
reported for this, and I hope it will bilge him."</p>

<p>Bligh now opened the door of his room and
looked out, expecting every moment to see
Harry Blunt emerge from the office. Bligh
was thoughtful for a while, then he took a
spool of black linen thread from a drawer in
his wardrobe. He tied one end of the thread
to the door-knob of the office and carried the
thread overhead through the open transom of
his room. He then sat in the chair by the
window holding the thread hauled taut; and
Bligh sat there for the next two hours, thread
in hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>At one o'clock his watchfulness was rewarded.
He saw the figure of a man steal up
over the terrace and across the passageway.
And in the moonlight he recognized the same
hat, moustache, beard and sack coat.</p>

<p>Bligh sat perfectly still, and it was not long
before the thread in his hand suddenly pulled
and snapped. Bligh quickly stepped to the
doorway of his room and looked out, and
there going down the corridor was Harry
Blunt in his service uniform.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Henry Bligh, midshipman, fourth
class, gave a pleased laugh and went to bed.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center">ROBERT GETS BAD NEWS</p>


<p>"Stone," said Robert Drake one Saturday
in March, "let's call on the Blunts this afternoon.
Captain Blunt is home on leave; his
ship, the 'New Orleans,' arrived in New York
last month. He's a splendid man."</p>

<p>Stonewell laughed. "Come along," he
replied, "and perhaps I'll have a chance to
see Mrs. Blunt; she's such a pleasant woman;
and then there's that scamp of a son of hers;
perhaps he may be at home. I haven't seen
much of him since the football season ended.
I never see him nowadays if he sees me first.
Mark my words, Bob, Harry Blunt is up to
some mischief, and he'll be getting into a lot
of trouble before long. Every time I pass him
he looks conscious. By the way, Bob, whom
have you asked to present the flag to your
company? You expect to win it, of course."</p>

<p>"Come along, Stone, and quit your fooling.
You know I'll be glad to see Captain Blunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and nowadays I don't need an excuse to call
on Helen. She is always pleasant and cordial.
I hope her brother won't get into any
trouble, but I've an idea he's taking lots of
liberties with the regulations. I imagine
there are not many of the six hundred and
sixty-five that he's not broken. I hope it
won't come my way to have to report him for
anything; I wish he were in some other company
than the first."</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were admitted into
the Blunt home, and were received as old
friends.</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Drake?" exclaimed
Captain Blunt, shaking Robert's hand
heartily. "And here is Mr. Stonewell, glad
to see you; I can't believe it's nearly four
years ago since I took you out on the 'Constellation.'
Then you were subdued plebes,
and now what a transformation! Here Mr.
Stonewell is cadet commander, and I'm not
surprised. And, Drake, here you are a cadet
lieutenant, and I'm told my son Harry is in
your company. How is he doing?"</p>

<p>"Very well, captain. He stands fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
well in his class and is very well liked. He
did wonders in football."</p>

<p>"So I've heard, but I want to know
whether he runs against the regulations or
not, that is, if he has been reported for any
serious offenses; for instance, to-day is Saturday
and he can't come out to Annapolis on
liberty, which means he is not on the first
conduct grade. Now what's he been doing?
That's what I want to know, and you can tell
me because you're his company commander."</p>

<p>"Nothing at all that I can recollect now,
sir, or for you to be concerned about. He
has probably been reported for not being
turned out at reveille inspection, or late at formation.
A few such reports would deprive
him of Saturday liberty in Annapolis. I'm
sure no serious reports have been made
against Harry. Had there been I should
have remembered them."</p>

<p>"And then of course you would speak of
them to his family."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I should not wish to."</p>

<p>"Come, Robert," interposed Helen Blunt,
"let father talk with Mr. Stonewell. Mr.
Stonewell is so solemn and he knows so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that he will just suit father. Come into the
dining-room."</p>

<p>As they walked away Helen said: "Robert,
I'm bothered to death about Harry and I
want you to help me. That brother of mine
is going to get into trouble, trouble bad
enough to get him dismissed, and that would
be a terrible misfortune for us."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any danger of that,
Helen. Harry is all right; he's just a little
careless, that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Robert," retorted Helen scornfully,
"would you think Harry was only a
little careless if you knew he was up-stairs
this instant? He comes out in town regularly
when he has no right to, and some time
he will be caught. And he will be reported
for something much worse than taking
French leave&mdash;he will be reported for something
that will dismiss him." And pretty
Helen was indignant and much concerned
over her brother's recklessness.</p>

<p>"Now, Robert Drake," she continued,
"you've just got to help me."</p>

<p>"I wish I could, Helen; I might intimidate
Harry, that's about all I could do. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
couldn't appeal to him with any success, I've
tried that; he would tell me to mind my own
business. Harry doesn't take preaching patiently.
Now another thing, Helen; he is in
my company. If you hear I ever report him
for anything I want you to believe I had to
do it and that I hated to."</p>

<p>"I'll know that beforehand, Robert," replied
Helen gently. "But Harry is very
good about such things; he never talks at
home about troubles with other midshipmen.
But now he is up-stairs, and he dare not come
down, for father would surely see him. Now
can't you and Mr. Stonewell start to go soon
and ask father to walk to the Academy
grounds with you? If Harry doesn't leave
the house soon he will be absent from supper
formation, and then he'll have to tell why,
and his being out in town would be found
out."</p>

<p>"I can't treat your father that way, Helen;
it wouldn't be right at all; but I must go myself
now."</p>

<p>As Robert went into the next room to take
his leave, he was in a state of great discomfort.
Helen Blunt had thoughtlessly put him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
into a very uncomfortable position. From
her point of view she felt justified in using
any means to get her father from the house.
But Robert felt he could not be a party to a
deception practised upon Captain Blunt, and
he was particularly uneasy as to how Helen
would take his refusal. He feared that to her
his attitude would appear priggish. But his
mind was soon eased in that respect, for Helen
said in a low voice: "I shouldn't have asked
you to do that, Robert; that wasn't nice of
me. I didn't think, but I'm so worried about
Harry."</p>

<p>"I'm going to walk to the yard with you,"
suddenly said Captain Blunt. "I'm going to
see the commandant for a few minutes, and if
you don't mind walking with an old fellow
like me we'll go together."</p>

<p>Robert was much relieved, and all three
soon left the house.</p>

<p>Half an hour later supper formation occurred,
and Robert was relieved to see Third
Classman Blunt in his customary place in
ranks. Toward that young man he now experienced
a sentiment of irritation, even of
indignation. He knew that Harry had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
taking unauthorized leave, or "Frenching,"
as it is called, one of the most serious offenses
a midshipman can commit, and evidently had
been jeopardizing his place as a midshipman.
To do this regularly in the face of his family's
protestations seemed to Robert to be utterly
callous.</p>

<p>After supper he accosted Harry and said:
"Blunt, you've been Frenching, and you've
got to stop it. If you keep it up you will
surely be caught and will stand a good chance
of being dismissed. You ought to have some
regard for your family, and personally I don't
mind saying I'd hate to be placed in a position
where I'd have to report you."</p>

<p>"Drake," replied Harry, "are you advising
me as a friend or speaking to me officially as
my company commander?"</p>

<p>"As a friend, I hope."</p>

<p>"Well, then," rejoined Harry in a short,
snappy way, "as a friend will you kindly
mind your own business?" and the young
man started away, whistling as he went, but
was instantly stopped by a sharp military
order of "Halt." Robert stood before him
with flashing eyes, and in menacing tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
said: "I'll not address you again as a friend,
Mr. Blunt; you will please to realize that
when I speak to you hereafter it will be your
company commander who is talking. And
you'll do no more whistling in my face. That
will do, sir. About face, march off."</p>

<p>Harry Blunt had a new sensation; he was
actually intimidated. He really liked Robert
as much as a third classman ever likes a
cadet officer, and in his heart was sorry he had
provoked Robert's displeasure. "But Drake
is a good chap," he later said to himself; "he'll
come around all right."</p>

<p>From here Robert went to his room.
"Hello, Bob," greeted Stonewell; "there's a
letter for you." Stonewell was busy writing
and after a few moments he looked up, and
suddenly cried out: "Why, Bob, what's the
matter; no bad news from home, I hope?"</p>

<p>Robert, with the letter clutched in his hand,
and with a quivering chin, looked the picture
of woe. He had evidently received some news
that made him very unhappy.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old chap?" inquired
Stonewell anxiously; "something has happened;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>what is it?" and the comforting kindness
of his tone went straight to Robert's
heart.</p>

<p>"Stone," he said, "this is a letter from
father; a month ago the railway company
that employed him was reorganized and he
lost his position. He has been half sick ever
since, and it's impossible for him to get employment.
He hadn't intended to tell me,
but he felt he ought to. You know mother
has been an invalid for years. Stone, I've got
to resign, there's no other way out of it.
Mother and father are sick, and no money is
coming in. I've got to go home to take care
of them."</p>

<p>Stonewell regarded him with his eyes full
of sympathy. "I'm dreadfully sorry, Bob,"
he said; "I'm sure your father will get employment.
But don't talk of resigning; you
might find it very difficult to secure employment
for yourself; you're too near graduation
to resign, and after you graduate you will be
in a position to help your father financially,
if he needs it. It would distress him terribly
if he thought for a moment you contemplated
leaving the naval service. I'm going out
for a while, Bob; now don't you feel so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
badly; I'm sure matters will right themselves."</p>

<p>Stonewell left and Robert paced up and
down the room with blurred eyes and a sad
heart. The condition of his father and
mother, ill and without resources, filled him
with agony. He longed to relieve them from
their troubles and anxieties; he dreaded the
unfriendliness and coldness dealt to people
without means, and thinking of the mental
torture his father was in overwhelmed him
with grief.</p>

<p>Stonewell went out into the city of Annapolis,
direct to where the Blunts lived. Here
he asked to see Captain Blunt and was soon
closeted with that gentleman.</p>

<p>"Captain," he commenced, "you knew my
roommate's father, didn't you, Mr. Drake? I
believe he was graduated from Annapolis
shortly after you were."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, he was a fine fellow, too; he
had a splendid record in the navy, and it was
a great pity he resigned. What about him,
Mr. Stonewell?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, Bob, my roommate, is in great
trouble about his father and mother, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
you and Mrs. Blunt are real friends of his I
thought I'd talk to you about it. Of course
Bob doesn't know I'm with you. His father
has lost his position and has no income, and
Bob thinks he ought to resign to go to
Chicago. He feels his duty is to be with his
father and mother. It would be such a pity
for him to resign so near his graduation. I
thought perhaps you might send for him and
influence him more than I could. I'm sure
he'll listen to you."</p>

<p>"By jingo, Stonewell," exploded Captain
Blunt, "I'm detached from my ship and
ordered to duty as secretary of the Light
House Board, and only to-day received a letter
asking me to recommend somebody, preferably
one familiar with marine matters, to be
chief clerk to the board. Drake's father
would be just the man. He will get living
pay and it's a life position. Let me have Mr.
Drake's address; I'll write to him to-night."</p>

<p>Upon his return to Bancroft Hall Stonewell
found Robert quiet and composed, but determined.
"I've got to do it, Stone," said
Robert handing his roommate an ominously
official-looking paper. In it he had formally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
tendered his resignation as a midshipman.
"It's a lifetime disappointment," he continued,
"but I've got to go home to my people. They
need me. Now I feel you're going to argue
with me and I beg you not to attempt to dissuade
me; nothing you or anybody could say
would change my determination. I feel terribly
about it and you would only make me
feel the worse. Please don't, Stone. I must
do my duty to my father and mother."</p>

<p>"I shall not attempt to dissuade you, Bob;
I know exactly how you feel. But I'm going
to ask you to do something for me. I feel as
if it would break my heart if you were to resign.
Now I'm going to ask you to let me
lend you fifty dollars. You can send this to
your father, and if he is in immediate need of
money this will help out for a few days. And
I want you to promise me you will delay your
resignation for one week. Surely you can do
this for me, and I have strong hopes that in a
week's time you will feel there is no need in
Chicago that would compel your resignation."</p>

<p>"That's awfully good of you, Stone, but can
you spare the fifty dollars? I feel I ought to
leave immediately, but if I could send father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
some money I might wait a week. The idea
of resigning is like death to my hopes."</p>

<p>"Of course I can; you know I've plenty of
money," replied Stonewell, jumping up enthusiastically.
"I know something good is
going to happen, Bob, and don't you worry;
you're not going to resign."</p>

<p>Stonewell's happiness was infectious and
Robert's heart seemed lightened from a heavy
load. Stonewell had gained his point and he
did not choose that Robert should learn from
him what Captain Blunt had in his mind for
Robert's father.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center">ROBERT GETS GOOD NEWS</p>


<p>The days following dragged slowly by for
the apprehensive Robert. His mind was full
of the needs of his father and mother and it
took real effort on his part to attend to his
duties and prepare his studies. He anxiously
awaited each mail delivery, but not until
Saturday morning after drill did any letters
come from him. He and Stonewell entered
their rooms together and Robert fairly
pounced on the two letters that were awaiting
him. Eagerly he tore open the letter in
his father's well-known handwriting, and
rapidly read it. Then he gave a shout of joy.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Stone?" he cried.
"Here's the happiest news in the world.
Father writes me that Captain Blunt has secured
a splendid position for him, chief clerk
of the Light House Board. Isn't that just
splendid? All of my worries are over; and
father returns the fifty dollars I sent him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I'm so happy, it seems as if a ton had been
lifted from me. I do hope I'll be able to convince
Captain Blunt of my gratitude to him.
What a wonderful thing to have such a friend,
Stone. But how did he come to do it?"
Robert paused a moment and then added:
"Stone, did you tell him of the trouble I
was in?"</p>

<p>"Bob, I told him you felt it was your duty
to resign, and I told him why. I wanted an
older friend than myself to advise you. It was
a liberty; but, by George, I can't feel it's a
case for an apology. I am just as happy as
you are, Bob. Jingo! but Captain Blunt is a
fine man."</p>

<p>"I do wish I could do something to show
him how much I appreciate what he has done
for me!" exclaimed Robert.</p>

<p>"You can," rejoined Stonewell. "There's
his son Harry. You can try to help him out
of trouble; he's pointed for a lot of it. There
are rocks and shoals ahead of him, and he's
pretty certain to get bumped hard."</p>

<p>"I can't do anything for that youngster,
Stone," replied Robert. "Positively he never
loses an opportunity of cheeking me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may have the chance, Bob; but why
don't you read your other letter?"</p>

<p>"I forgot I had another letter. Hello,
this is from Stanton; let's see what he says."</p>

<p>"What! Stanton!" queried Stonewell.
"Do you mean last year's five striper?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what a splendid fellow he is. He
says he is having a fine time aboard the 'Paul
Jones,' a torpedo boat destroyer, and he's
learning a lot. He says his ship made a good
record at the last target practice but it will do
much better next time. His captain is devising
a new sight for the six-pounder gun; the
one now attached to that style of gun is very
poor. Stanton says that anybody can get up
a better sight, and now the Navy Department
is allowing officers to make improvements on
the guns they are going to fire at target practice.
That's what our instructor in gunnery
said last October, don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and by the way, Bob, now that your
mind is easy about everything you had better
get busy if you expect your company to win
the flag this year. You've got a good company,
but so has Blair, and he's red hot after
the flag. He'll wipe your eye, Bob, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
don't hustle. And it's getting late in the
year."</p>

<p>"That's right. I'll get busy next week.
Let's see, now my company does well in infantry
and artillery; I ought to beat Blair in those
subjects."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Blair's company is pretty sure to
get first place in seamanship, and on the whole
his company is better, more numerously represented
in the different forms of athletics
than yours is. As an offhand guess I would
say the second company has a better show for
the flag than yours has. You see the total
possible multiple for the entire brigade is 3,000.
Blair will probably get fifty points in fencing,
and he has a lot of fellows on the track and
field teams; he'll probably get 100 points there;
and the best gymnasts of the Academy belong
to his company; besides, the second company
is certainly as well represented as the first
company in the football and baseball squads
and in the crew. You may make it, Bob, but
you won't if you don't get your company
stirred up."</p>

<p>"By George, Stone," cried Robert, "I'd
rather win that flag than have five stripes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
My company is all right; we will average just
as well in drills and in athletics as the second
company. We haven't done much talking of
what we're going to do, but don't imagine
we've forgotten about the flag. We are after
it, hard and strong."</p>

<p>"If you do win it, I'll wager a hundred
dollars to an onion that you'll deserve to win.
Blair is not to be easily beaten," replied Stonewell.</p>

<p>"Let's go out and call on the Blunts," suddenly
proposed Robert. "I want to thank
the captain."</p>

<p>"Don't say another word, Mr. Drake," Captain
Blunt was saying to Robert later the
same day; "your feeling for your father is
natural and does you credit. I was really
glad to be of service to him and to you; but
aside from all that, the Light House Board is
glad to get your father for its chief clerk; he
is just the man we need. So we are all
pleased. How is my boy Harry coming
along? By George! I could have sworn I
saw him ahead of me on Maryland Avenue
to-day; you don't think Harry is Frenching,
do you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope he isn't, captain. I should be inexpressibly
sorry if he were and I had to report
him for it. You know he is in my company."</p>

<p>"If you find him Frenching I want you to
report him," savagely rejoined Captain Blunt.
"Don't have any false notions on that subject,
Mr. Drake."</p>

<p>"That is a matter of great concern to me,
captain," replied Robert in tones of anxiety.
"I'd almost prefer to bilge than to report your
son for a serious matter. He is a splendid
fellow; everybody likes him and admires him.
But he is undoubtedly reckless and careless.
The great trouble to me is that he won't let
me speak to him except officially. He is impatient
of advice and won't listen to any from
me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake, I desire and expect you to report
him when you ought to do so. Don't
worry about that."</p>

<p>Helen, growing impatient at this long conversation,
said suddenly, "Robert, I made
some fudge this morning; won't you come
back in the pantry with me and help me bring
it out?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as they were out of hearing, she
said in a low voice: "Harry is up-stairs again,
and he can't come down to get away without
father seeing him. What shall I do? Harry
is terribly afraid of his father."</p>

<p>"The only advice I can give you, Helen, is
to tell your father he is there. You can't
cover up his tracks, and I don't know anybody
except his father who can influence him."</p>

<p>This advice to Helen seemed too explosive,
and she felt she could devise some way herself
to protect Harry, and she must make him feel
that he must never, never do it again. So she
remained silent.</p>

<p>When they returned to the drawing-room
Robert felt ill at ease. Mrs. Blunt, always
sympathetically friendly to him, engaged him
in talk; but after a few minutes Robert got up
to take his leave, accompanied by Stonewell.</p>

<p>"Weren't you in a bit of a rush, Bob?" inquired
Stonewell, glancing keenly at his
roommate.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," replied Robert uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you found young Blunt eating
pie in the pantry," remarked Stonewell.</p>

<p>"Not that close, Stone, but I guess he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in the house. Now what am I to do? I can
just see that before long I'll be in a fix where
I'll have to report young Blunt for a bilging
offense, the son of the man that has every claim
to my gratitude&mdash;or else I'll have to go back
on the strongest principles I possess. What
am I to do, Stone?"</p>

<p>"That's a hard problem; we'll think about
it, and perhaps we may be able to intimidate
Blunt. Perhaps I may find a means to influence
him. By the way, did you know that
the first class has late liberty to-night? Penfield
is going to play Richard the Third at the
Colonial Theatre. It's a great opportunity.
I went to the commandant, and our class is
going to have eleven-thirty liberty. It's Penfield's
best play; and I already have our
tickets. Aren't you pleased, Bob?"</p>

<p>Robert looked at his roommate in sheer astonishment.
"Well, of all things!" he said.
"To think of your knowing that for hours
and never mentioning it. Why, I was talking
with Mrs. Blunt and Helen about the play
and wishing I could go. I'm immensely
pleased. But why didn't you speak of it before,
Stone?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I just didn't. In fact I haven't told
anybody. The news will be announced at
supper formation, so you know it sooner than
anybody else does. And we'll have a glorious
time."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted," cried Robert. "Stone,
this is just fine. Bully for old Dalton. He's
a daisy commandant."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center">"THREE GROANS FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT"</p>


<p>Great was the delight of first classmen at
the privilege of theatre liberty, a rare privilege
for midshipmen; and loud and deep
were the indignant murmurs of midshipmen
other than first classmen to whom this privilege
was not accorded.</p>

<p>"There's no reason, no reasonable reason
why the second and third classmen should not
go," protested Third Classman Blunt at supper.
"I'm in favor of the whole third class going
in a body; we'll show the authorities what
we think of the commandant's ridiculous
treatment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Blunt, you are called to order," rang
out the sharp, dictatorial voice of Cadet Lieutenant
Drake, sitting at the head of the table.
"You are inciting mutiny and speaking disrespectfully
of your superior officers."</p>

<p>Harry Blunt was plainly cowed and subsided
for a time; but later said in a low tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to a classmate sitting on his right: "I'm going
out anyway; it won't be the first time I
have gone over the wall."</p>

<p>"You'd be recognized at the theatre and
spotted, and you'd be missed at taps inspection;
you had better not try it," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," grumbled Harry,
"but I've a pretty good trick up my sleeve,
and I may work it."</p>

<p>Later, when the first classmen were all gone
and the corridors were deserted, Third Classman
Blunt might have been seen to slip into room
number 23, the divisional officers' room.
And in a few minutes he came out looking
perplexed and worried.</p>

<p>The Colonial Theatre was a gay sight that
Saturday night. All of society Annapolis was
present, the ladies beautifully gowned, and the
men in correct evening dress. Annapolis
prides itself on being as strict in such matters
as Newport. Interspersed throughout the
audience were to be seen many navy uniforms;
and well toward the front and centre, in seats
reserved for them, were seated as fine a body
of young men as had ever been brought together,
the senior class of midshipmen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed more like a friendly party than
an ordinary audience, for everybody knew
everybody else, and before the curtain rose
there were innumerable greetings and much
pleasant talk.</p>

<p>But to the "costume de rigeur" so faithfully
observed by the Annapolitans, there was
one exception. In a back seat of a box, on the
right of the stage (a public box where seats
were sold separately) sat a man dressed in
defiance of social custom. He was simply
clothed in a sack coat, and trousers of dark
material. He wore a heavy moustache and
full pointed beard. However, he didn't seem
to know anybody and none appeared to notice
him or worry over his unconventional attire.</p>

<p>Penfield had an appreciative audience that
night. Never had anything so fine been given
at Annapolis, and enthusiastic delight was repeatedly
expressed.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes before ten the bearded
man in the box suddenly left and once outside
of the theatre he started at a dead run toward
the Academy grounds. A convenient
negro made twenty-five cents by boosting him
over the wall. The bearded man rushed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the Chesapeake Bay side of the Armory and
Bancroft Hall, ran over the terrace, and
bolted into the open window of room 23.
The five minutes' warning bugle was soon
heard, to be followed by the call for taps.
And in Bancroft Hall was to be heard the
measured tread of the midshipmen on
duty making the ten o'clock inspection of
rooms.</p>

<p>Hardly had this ceased when the bearded
man emerged from Bancroft Hall by the same
way he had entered it. He was off on a bound
and ran through the grounds unobserved.
The wall presented no difficulty to him, and
he was soon back in his seat in the theatre
box.</p>

<p>"What luck," he said to himself, with great
satisfaction. "I got out in the first place, got
back again, was in my bed at taps inspection,
and now I'm back here and have missed only
a little of the play. And nobody saw me or
knows anything about it."</p>

<p>The play proceeded. At a little before
eleven, near the end, while some scenery was
being changed, the manager of the theatre
stepped out on the stage and called:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is Midshipman Stonewell present?"</p>

<p>"I am he," replied Stonewell, rising in his
seat.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but the superintendent of the
Naval Academy has just telephoned me to
have Midshipman Stonewell send in all midshipmen
on the run." Before Stonewell had
a chance to reply or give an order, and before
the look of dismay and disappointment had
disappeared from his classmates' faces, everybody
in the theatre was startled by a loud cry
in harsh, strident tones of:</p>

<p>"Midshipmen and everybody else, attention!"</p>

<p>An intense breathless stillness followed.
Everybody looked to the direction from where
the cry had come. There, in the front of the
right hand box, stood a tall athletic looking
man. Now a brown slouch hat was pulled
down on his forehead; his face was covered
with a dark beard. He wore a sack coat buttoned
tightly over his chest.</p>

<p>By this penetrating voice everybody's attention
was attracted. An expectant hush fell
upon the audience. Every eye was upon the
bearded stranger.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>From the lips of the interrupter came a
defiant call of:</p>

<p>"Three groans for the superintendent of
the Naval Academy and the commandant.
Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh."</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation came ringing
orders from Stonewell:</p>

<p>"First classmen, rise! March out on the
double. Form in two ranks outside."</p>

<p>There was no hesitation or delay in obeying
Stonewell's order. Swiftly they ran out
of the theatre and halted on the walk outside.
And almost immediately they were put in
motion by Stonewell's order of "First classmen,
forward, double time-march," and
away they sped. Soon fire-bells were heard
ringing and the siren in the Academy grounds
was emitting long, terrifying blasts.</p>

<p>"Something's afire in the Naval Academy,
Bob," cried Stonewell; "hurry." The first
classmen dashed to the Maryland Avenue gate
and here were met by streams of lower class
midshipmen, starting to drag out the different
hose reels. The first classmen immediately
assumed charge of their various commands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>The fire proved to be in the carpen-ter's
shop, and in a very few minutes it was
put out.</p>

<p>After the midshipmen were back in their
quarters the one topic of conversation was the
startling event in the theatre.</p>

<p>The next morning was Sunday. Shortly
after ten o'clock, when the commandant had
finished his inspection of rooms, Cadet Lieutenant
Drake appeared at the door of Midshipman
Blunt's room and said: "Blunt, report
to the commandant's office immediately."</p>

<p>Harry Blunt clutched the table as if for
support, and with pallid face and in trembling
tones he asked: "What does he want
me for?"</p>

<p>"You'll know when he tells you," and
Robert walked out. It was not with his usual
debonair manner that Harry Blunt entered
the commandant's presence. In fact it was a
very scared youth who confronted Commander
Dalton. Fear and apprehension were plainly
depicted in his face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blunt," commenced the commandant,
"your father, mother and sister are to dine at
my house to-day, and I want you to come too.
Your father tells me he hasn't seen much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
you of late; you are not on the first conduct
grade, are you? If you are not I'll dispense
with the regulation and grant you special permission
to dine with an officer to-day."</p>

<p>Harry Blunt suddenly sat down on a chair
behind him. He was momentarily speechless.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Blunt," smiled the commandant.
Then Harry stood up.</p>

<p>"Wa-wa-was that all you wanted to see me
for?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes; we dine at half-past one."</p>

<p>"Thank you, captain; I'll be delighted to
dine with you and be with my father. This
is awfully kind of you, captain. Oh, thank
you; yes, indeed, I'll be there&mdash;I don't believe
I've ever called on you, captain, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, Mr. Blunt," interrupted the
commandant, "what is the matter with you?
At first when you came into my office you
seemed to be bereft of speech, and all of a
sudden you talk with such a rush that you
can't stop yourself. Perhaps you thought I
was going to talk about something else," and
Commander Dalton glanced keenly at Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p><p>"Be at my house by half-past one," repeated
the commandant, dismissing Harry,
and the latter left. He took several deep
breaths when out of the commandant's office.</p>

<p>"By George," he said, almost aloud, in
tones of great relief, "I feared I was up
against it. I was never so scared in all my
life."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center">ROBERT MAKES A DISCOVERY</p>


<p>"Pete," said Robert a few days later, "let's
go to the gun shed."</p>

<p>"All right," replied the amiable Peters,
"come along; but what are we to do there? I
don't know of any more uninteresting place
in the whole Academy."</p>

<p>"You know that our company is going to
try hard to win the flag, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course we are. And so is every other
company. Don't think for a minute, Bob,
that you're the only cadet lieutenant who has
picked out the girl who's going to present it.
But what has the gun shed to do with our
company winning the flag?"</p>

<p>"It all counts, Pete; you know part of the
grand multiple each company makes is made
up of its record at target practice with six-pounder
guns, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, I received a letter from Stanton last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
week; he says the sights of this gun are very
poor. Now in our gunnery sections we were
all encouraged to make improvements. You
see gunnery in the navy is now a matter of
terrific competition; it is ship against ship and
gun against gun. At each target practice the
ship that does the best carries the gunnery
trophy for a year, and big money prizes are
won by the best gun crews. And officers in
command of different guns are encouraged to
make improvements. Why, just before the
Spanish war the twelve-inch guns of the
'Texas' could only shoot once in five minutes,
and then the shots didn't hit often. On her
last target practice those same guns fired once
a minute and hit the target almost every time.
And the improvements were all made by
officers aboard the ship."</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, here is your six-pounder gun;
just take a look at it. I don't imagine you
will be allowed to do much tinkering with it.
You don't know a great deal about the gun&mdash;not
nearly so much as the men who designed
and built it&mdash;and here you are talking about
improving it. You would probably injure
rather than improve it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know how to work it, anyway, and I
have fired a six-pounder a number of times,"
replied Robert, rapidly throwing down a
couple of clamps, and turning the gun on its
pivot.</p>

<p>"I have no notion of touching the mechanism
of the gun; but Stanton says the gun
sights are poor; that anybody could put better
sights on the gun."</p>

<p>Robert now put himself at the rear of the
gun, assuming the prescribed position of the
man who fired it, holding it securely by the
shoulder and hand of his right arm, his left
hand being at the trigger. He ran his eye
over the gun sights, and moved the gun up
and down, and from side to side.</p>

<p>"Pete," he remarked, "look at this rear
sight; it's an open sight&mdash;just a mere notch,
a groove. And the forward sight is just a
sharp point. If I screw my eye up or down,
or from side to side, I might think there were
many different places the gun would shoot to.
When the gun is fired in this exact position
the shot is going in only one direction, but I
bet you if ten different fellows should aim
along these sights as the gun is now and say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
where the shot was going to hit you would
find there were ten different opinions."</p>

<p>"Of course there would be," replied Peters
in a superior tone; "there always are with
open sights; professional marksmen always use
peep-sights."</p>

<p>"Pete, you're a treasure," cried Robert in
enthusiastic approval; "we'll fit peep-sights to
this gun, but we'll keep it a dead secret, and
when we come to fire our string of shots we'll
use our own peep-sights."</p>

<p>"How are you going to fit peep-sights to
this gun and not have everybody else know
about it?" asked Peters dubiously. "And
we only practice with this gun; we will actually
fire one of the 'Nevada's' six-pounders,&mdash;and
probably the sight you fitted to this
gun wouldn't fit the 'Nevada's.'"</p>

<p>"Let's go aboard the 'Nevada'; she's alongside
the 'Santee' wharf, and we'll talk to the
captain. I know him, and we'll ask him to let
us fit up the six-pounder we're going to use.
There's a gunner's mate named Lenn aboard
that ship who is a great friend of mine; he's
awfully handy with tools, and he'll help me."</p>

<p>"But, Bob, a captain isn't going to let a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
midshipman monkey with the guns of his
ship."</p>

<p>"The 'Nevada' is in reserve with a crew of
only thirty-five men on board; she's here for
the instruction of midshipmen, and besides,
we're not going to make any permanent
change; we're going to invent a new six-pounder
gun sight; we'll just take off the old
sights and put in our own peep-sights; the
captain can put the other ones back if he
wants to."</p>

<p>"You talk as if you had already invented
your peep-sights and all you had to do was to
put them on. Now let me tell you, Bob, it
isn't so all-fired easy. This gun isn't fitted
for peep-sights. Another thing, the rear sight
is attached here to a graduated bar; it moves
up and down according to the distance of the
target you are firing at, and it also moves
from side to side, to allow for the speed of the
ship. Now you're going to have a good deal
of trouble to arrange an entire new kind of
sights for this gun."</p>

<p>"Pete, those are problems that I'm sure can
be solved. I don't pretend to say I know just
how we can make the change, but I'm going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to study the question, and I'm going to get
expert help. Now let's go over to the 'Nevada'
and talk with Captain Brice; we've got
to get his consent first; and then I'll get that
smart gunner's mate, Lenn, to help me; he's
a very inventive chap. Come along."</p>

<p>Before long the two midshipmen were
aboard the monitor "Nevada" and were talking
with Captain Brice. At first the latter
was utterly opposed to any "monkeying," as
he expressed it, with one of his guns. Finally
he became interested in Robert's earnestness,
and relented to the extent of the following ultimatum:</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Drake, I'll allow you to remove
the present sights of one of my six-pounders;
the sights are kept out of the gun, anyway,
for that matter; and in their places you may
put in new sights. But you are not to alter
the gun in any way; you must fix it so that
any sights you put in can be immediately replaced
by the regular sights. I'll send for the
man you want, Lenn, and tell him to give
you a hand."</p>

<p>Chief Gunner's Mate Lenn soon appeared,
and he and the two midshipmen repaired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the forward starboard six-pounder on the superstructure
deck, where Robert explained
what he wanted. Lenn grasped the idea with
avidity.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Drake," he said, "we can fix
up what you want with no trouble at all. A
sight is a simple thing&mdash;the principle is that
the centre line of the gun's bore must be exactly
parallel to the line of sight at point-blank
range with no speed allowance. Now
you want a peep-sight. We'll get a hollow
cylinder, say an inch in diameter, and an inch
or two long; we'll plug the end and drill a fine
hole in the end of your plug. There's the
peep. And the forward sight will be a ring
with cross wires in it. Now your line from
the peep-hole to the cross wires must be parallel
to the axis of the gun. And while I
think of it the rear and front sights should be
as far apart as possible; I'll tell you what we'll
do; we'll carry the sight at the end of a long
piece of brass pipe; I've just the stuff in my
storeroom. I'll fit a Y piece to where the
present front sight is, pivot it there and hang
the forward part of the pipe in its gimbals.
I'll just run a quarter-inch pin through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
pipe; and I'll drop the rear end of the brass
pipe on this rear sight&mdash;I'll have to make a
slight alteration in this rear sight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't change a thing, Lenn, you
mustn't," interrupted Robert. "Captain Brice
will not allow any changes of the gun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've an old condemned rear sight below;
I'll use that," smiled Lenn. "Now we'll
fasten our new front cross wire and rear
peep-sights to the ends of our brass pipe&mdash;why,
anybody can see at a glance it will be a far
better arrangement than the present poor
system."</p>

<p>When Robert and Peters left Lenn said:
"Come aboard the 'Nevada' in two days from
now and you'll find your new sights on this
gun ready for business."</p>

<p>On the following Saturday, after supper,
Robert and Stonewell were enjoying a pleasant
call at the Blunt household. Captain Blunt
was telling Stonewell of the last target practice
his ship had gone through. "Why, sir,"
he said, "if my six-pounders had not done so
poorly I would surely have won the trophy;
my six-inch guns averaged seven hits a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
minute, each of the best guns making ten hits.
If we had had decent sights for our six-pounders
the 'New Orleans' would have made
the best record of any ship of her class in the
navy."</p>

<p>Robert was eagerly listening, and was much
interested, but Helen Blunt wasn't.</p>

<p>"Father," she interrupted, "you talk of
nothing but guns, guns, guns and hits per
minute. Now that isn't nearly so interesting
to midshipmen as ice-cream and cake. Robert,
come along to the pantry with me and help
me get some."</p>

<p>That young man was on the point of asking
Captain Blunt a question about six-pounder
gun sights, but Helen was already on her way
toward the hall; so he thought his question
could wait, and he started to join Helen. She
had gone to the rear of the house, to the pantry
next the kitchen. The passageway was dark,
but Robert knew the way, and he hurried
after Helen, and soon ran right into her.</p>

<p>"You are a regular blunderer, aren't you,
Robert?" she laughed. "I am trying to turn
on the light but can't find the key. What a
bother it is that in Annapolis all the servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
go home at night&mdash;and there goes the doorbell.
I'll have to go see who it is. Now try
to find the switch; it's somewhere near on this
wall. Just feel about and you'll find it. I
hope you're not afraid to be left in the dark,"
was her parting shot, "but the kitchen door
is locked, so that no burglars can get in."
And Helen ran away.</p>

<p>Robert groped about, but could not find the
switch to the electric light, and while he was
fumbling his ear caught the noise of a click in
the kitchen, as if a door had been unlocked.
A moment later he heard a door opened, and
with it he felt the draft blow on him.</p>

<p>"Some one has let himself into the kitchen,"
thought Robert. He kept quite still, wondering
who it might be. Then he heard footsteps
on the kitchen floor; they seemed quite
close to him and he felt confident there was
an intruder there. He peered through the
open door of the pantry into the kitchen, but
in the dark could see nothing; suddenly an
electric light in the kitchen was turned on,
and Robert, himself unseen, looked with fascination
on the person he saw.</p>

<p>There standing by a table was a man with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
brown slouch hat drawn down over his eyes, a
man with a heavy moustache and dark pointed
beard; he was dressed in a dark sack coat,
buttoned closely across his chest and wore
trousers of a dark material.</p>

<p>Robert felt his breath come quickly.</p>

<p>"What can this man be doing here?" he
wondered. "I know him; he's the scoundrel
who called for three groans for the superintendent
and commandant."</p>

<p>Robert had a confused idea that the stranger
might be a thief and he was wondering what
he had best do, when suddenly a feeling of
dismay and horror swept over him. The
stranger threw off his hat, and with a quick
movement of each hand unhooked from around
his ears the support of what was evidently a
false beard. And the merry face of Harry
Blunt was revealed.</p>

<p>It is difficult to analyze Robert's feelings,
but chief among them was an utter detestation
for Harry. That a midshipman, himself
the son of a splendid officer, should be the
miscreant who had so wantonly, so publicly,
insulted the highest officers at the Naval
Academy, filled Robert with disgust.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/i002.png" width="474" height="700" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>THE STRANGER THREW OFF
HIS HAT</i></span></span>
</div>

<p>For a midshipman to take unauthorized
leave was a common offense, so also was it for
a midshipman to have civilian clothing in his
possession. Such offenses were committed at
great personal risk and when detected brought
down upon the offender's head severe punishment,
and if repeated it meant dismissal. But
reprehensible from a military view-point as it
was, such an offense was not dishonorable.</p>

<p>Since the event at the Colonial Theatre none
at Annapolis had ever had the slightest notion
that the perpetrator of the insult of that night
could be a midshipman; such an idea never was
suggested, never even entered any person's
mind. And so to Robert, his recognition of
Harry Blunt as the culprit was as astounding as
it was painful. He loathed Harry as an utterly
unfit, dishonorable person, who had done
shameful wrong to the Naval Academy. And
immediately there arose in Robert's mind the
knowledge that it was his duty to report
Harry to the commandant, to report the son
of his benefactor.</p>

<p>In agonized perplexity Robert turned and
quietly walked through the dining-room to
the hall.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a><br /><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you find the cakes and things in the
pantry, Robert?" cried Helen seeing him, "or
did you get tired waiting for me? Mr. Farnum
called, and he comes so seldom I felt I couldn't
run away from him. Why, Robert, what's
the matter? You have such a strange look on
your face. What is it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I couldn't find the light, Helen,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come back and try it again. But
what is the matter, Robert? I'm sure something's
the matter."</p>

<p>"I'm not feeling well, Helen. I&mdash;I&mdash;have to
go&mdash;I can't stay,&mdash;please say good-night to your
father and mother&mdash;I really must go," and
with utter misery showing in every feature,
Robert grabbed his hat and bolted out of the
house.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="center">HARRY BLUNT IS REBUFFED</p>


<p>Helen Blunt was grieved and hurt at
Robert's strange action. It was incomprehensible
to her. The others expressed much
surprise at his sudden leaving. After a few
minutes Helen got the refreshments, but she
was much subdued for the rest of the evening,
and it was only too evident that the pleasure
of the day had gone for her.</p>

<p>Robert hurried back to the Academy and
was soon in his room.</p>

<p>"I can't report him," he reflected. "I know
I'm going back on my rank, on my duty, on
my principles, on what I've preached ever
since I've been at the Academy. The contemptible
hound! He ought to be kicked
out! It's a shame that such a despicable person
should have such a fine father and mother&mdash;and&mdash;and
sister. It's outrageous that he
should remain here. But his father saved my
father&mdash;I can't report him; it would utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
disgrace Captain Blunt&mdash;I'm full of gratitude
to him&mdash;I suppose I have no right to let that
gratitude interfere with my duty; but I can't
help myself."</p>

<p>For the next hour Robert indulged himself
in many bitter reflections, but his conclusions
were unchanged, and he deliberately determined
to keep to himself what he had learned,
neither to report Harry Blunt nor to tell even
Stonewell what he had seen.</p>

<p>Stonewell came in a little before ten o'clock.
"What's the matter with you, Bob?" he
asked almost roughly. "Do you think you
treated the Blunts very politely? You spoiled
Helen's evening, and I could see Captain and
Mrs. Blunt were concerned; they must have
thought you acted very queerly, to say the
least."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Stone&mdash;I couldn't help it.
Please don't talk about it to me."</p>

<p>Stonewell glanced keenly at his roommate's
worried face. "Look here, Bob, when you
went out to the pantry did you see young
Blunt? Has that scamp been Frenching
again?"</p>

<p>"Stone, except once, you have practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
never discussed your personal matters with
me; I never insist on it, intimate as we are.
Now this is a personal matter of a kind that I
just can't talk about; please don't expect me
to."</p>

<p>"All right, Bob; but it's my opinion you
feel you ought to report Blunt for Frenching
and you feel you can't because you're under
obligation of lasting gratitude to his father;
and so you feel you're going back on your
principles, and so forth. Now you were not
on duty; no reasonable man would expect
you to violate your own feelings to that
extent. So cheer up, Bob; I'll tell you right
now that if when I'm not on duty I find
young Blunt Frenching in his father's house,
I most certainly shall not report him."</p>

<p>To this Robert made no comment, but in
his heart thought that if his roommate knew
what a scoundrel Blunt was, that Stonewell
would be the very first to report him.</p>

<p>Taps soon sounded, and before long Robert
was in bed; but long hours passed before
sleep came to him. "What a lot of terrible
rogues I've been mixed up with," was one of
the thoughts that came to his mind; "there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was Hillman, Ramsay, Williams, and now this
detestable Blunt. And of them all I fear
Blunt is the worst."</p>

<p>The next afternoon Stonewell went to
Blunt's room and found that young man
there alone. "Hello, Stone," greeted Blunt;
"but now that football is over perhaps I
should say Mister Stonewell to the five
striper."</p>

<p>"Never mind the 'Mister,' Blunt. I
thought I'd drop around to tell you that I
think you are an unintentional cad."</p>

<p>"Your words are offensive, sir," cried
Harry, getting angry immediately; "I'm not
aware of any Naval Academy regulation that
permits the cadet commander to insult a
third classman."</p>

<p>"I don't wish to insult you, Blunt, and I
admit my words require explanation. The
point is just this: Bob Drake, your company
commander, is entirely upset about something.
He will not talk about it to me, and has no
idea of my seeing you about the matter. He
was out at your father's house last night, and
I've a notion you were Frenching out there
and he saw you. You probably know he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
very strict notions of duty. My idea is that
he feels he should report you or else go back
on every principle he ever had. And for a
particular reason he cannot report you."</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Harry disdainfully, "if the
reason is that he is currying favor with Helen
most people would say Drake is the cad."</p>

<p>"It isn't your sister, Blunt. It's your
father, whom he owes a debt of gratitude to."</p>

<p>"Why should Drake be grateful to my
father?" exclaimed Harry in evident surprise.</p>

<p>"For personal reasons. I don't feel at
liberty to talk about them, except to say that
a couple of weeks ago a kind action on your
father's part saved Drake from resigning.
You see Drake cannot report your father's
son; and come now, wouldn't a man be a cad
to force a man like Drake to go back on his
principles?"</p>

<p>"Good old dad," cried Harry impulsively;
"I was a cad, but I'm glad you said unintentionally
so. I'd have had no use for Drake
if it had been on Helen's account. But really
I didn't know Drake saw me last night. Are
you sure he did?"</p>

<p>"I have just imagined so; you ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
know whether he did or not. He was at your
house last night; at half-past eight he went
out in the pantry to get something and all of
a sudden bolted out of the house. He won't
speak of the matter even to me, but he has
been miserable ever since."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" ejaculated Harry. "Perhaps
he saw me in the cit's clothes; that would be
a bilging spot,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> wouldn't it?"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A report involving dismissal.</p></div>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," remarked Stonewell,
drily.</p>

<p>"Stonewell, I'm obliged to you, and I'll
tell you right now I won't give Drake another
chance to report me for Frenching; I'm
awfully sorry the thing happened. I'll tell
him I'll do the square thing hereafter."</p>

<p>In the meantime Robert and Peters had
gone aboard the "Nevada"; Lenn saw them
coming. "Come up above," he said to them;
"I've something to show you." When Robert
saw what this something was he was delighted.
Lenn had fitted up the forward starboard six-pounder
gun with the gun sights they had
talked about.</p>

<p>"I've bore sighted the gun, Mr. Drake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>Just train the gun on that white stone on the
shore over there; look through your peep-sight
and get the gun exactly on it. All
right. Now shift your eye to the bore; the
bore sights are in the gun. Now what do you
say?"</p>

<p>"It's wonderful," cried Robert; "are these
bore sights in the exact centre of the gun?"</p>

<p>"Within a hair's breadth."</p>

<p>"Both the new gun sights and the bore
sights are pointing at the white stone. The
stone is over half a mile away. That means
the line of the gun sights is parallel to the
axis of the gun, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"It does, indeed," replied Lenn, much
pleased with Robert's enthusiastic approval.</p>

<p>"Let me see," insisted Peters, pushing
Robert away from the breech of the gun.
"Gee, but this is splendid," he called out a
moment later. "Say, Bob, if you keep this
quiet you'll make the gunnery record next
June."</p>

<p>"Lenn, can we prevent people from seeing
these sights?"</p>

<p>"Surely. I'll take them down when you
leave; it only takes a minute to take them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
off the gun. I'll keep them in my storeroom
when you're not using them; but, Mr.
Drake, if you expect to make a good target
record you'll have lots of work to do. You'll
have to get your crew here day after day, for
at least half an hour's drill. I'll be here to
help you."</p>

<p>"Good. And thank you, Lenn; I'll start
to-morrow." And the two midshipmen left
the ship.</p>

<p>"Now, Pete," said Robert, "we must organize
to win the flag. Our company is well
represented in all forms of athletics; we have
football and baseball stars in it; now you and
I and Glassfell and a couple of others will
quietly drill with this gun. And at target
practice we'll spring a great surprise on everybody.
Whom had we better put in the gun's
crew with us?"</p>

<p>"Well, let's see. There's young Blunt, he's
a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't speak of that fellow to me," interrupted
Robert savagely.</p>

<p>"Why, Bob, what has he done; why are you
so down on him?" inquired Peters, utterly
surprised at Robert's vehemence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want nothing to do with him. I don't
wish to talk about him."</p>

<p>"All right, old man, I'll think of some one
else. Will see you later."</p>

<p>As soon as Robert saw his roommate later
in the day, he began eagerly to tell him of his
plans. "I'm going out to win the flag, Stone.
My company stands as good a chance, better, I
believe, than any other company to win it.
But I'm going to make sure of it. Now you
drill with my company, and what you individually
do will count."</p>

<p>"Of course. And I'll do all I can. I want
you to come out for the crew, Bob; you've
pulled in two winning races&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't, Stone; now just listen to what
I've done," and Robert told Stonewell of
the new six-pounder gun sights and of what
he expected to accomplish. "You see I'll
not be able to come out for racing shell
practice, and besides, you don't need me&mdash;my
company is well represented in all athletics
and if we win at target practice we'll get
the flag."</p>

<p>Here the door was thrown open and Harry
Blunt entered. Robert jumped to his feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and with flashing eyes and in angry tones
asked: "What do you want, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why, Drake," replied Harry, completely
taken back by this hostile reception, "I just
thought I would tell you that if any act of
mine has disturbed you, if I have forced you
in a false position, I extremely regret it; I
hope you will have no further concern because
of me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blunt, will you please leave my room?
I despise you and I want nothing whatever to
do with you."</p>

<p>"This is decent of you, Blunt, and I thank
you for coming in," suddenly interposed
Stonewell. "I know your motive, and it's
all right!"</p>

<p>Harry Blunt stood in the doorway utterly
chagrined. Tears came into his eyes and his
chin quivered. Then without comment he
left the room. Stonewell was extremely
provoked. "He came in at my suggestion,"
he angrily said.</p>

<p>"I believe you," replied Robert calmly.</p>

<p>"I don't like the way you have acted. I
don't understand you."</p>

<p>"Stone, I despise Blunt. There is a reason.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
You think you know it, but you are mistaken.
Now, old friend, I cannot talk this matter
over with you; I can but ask you to trust me,
also to avoid discussing that young man when
I am around."</p>

<p>Stonewell was not inclined at first to be
satisfied with this, but he soon decided to
drop the matter; and several months passed
before Midshipman Harry Blunt was discussed
between them.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="center">A MYSTERY SOLVED</p>


<p>The end of March brought with it to Annapolis
a veritable blizzard; the ground everywhere
was covered with snow. The soft snow,
clinging to the tree branches, had commenced
to melt, when promise of good weather suddenly
changed to sharp cold, followed by another
snow-storm. The intense cold had
turned the trees into glistening skeletons, and
the powdered white falling upon them made
a beautiful picture, but the weight caused
many branches to break, and Annapolis presented
a most wintry spectacle. And then of
a sudden out burst the sun, sending down hot
rays that in a few days turned winter into
spring. In but a short time all the trees
were budding and spring, turning rapidly
into summer, came with leaps and bounds and
the bleak desolate days were soon forgotten.</p>

<p>There remained to Robert Drake but two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
months more of Academy life&mdash;two months of
deep contentment. He surveyed his previous
four years and drew much satisfaction in contemplating
them. He was sure to graduate
high in his class, with probably only Stonewell,
Farnum, Sewall and Ryerson ahead of
him. He had had troubles, but everything
now seemed clear sailing before him.</p>

<p>Midshipmen enjoy these last months of the
school year. Out of town friends by the hundreds
come to Annapolis, and after drills and
on Saturdays and Sundays, the Naval Academy
grounds are thronged with pretty girls, each
flanked by at least one midshipman, and some
by ten.</p>

<p>Every afternoon saw the midshipmen at
their infantry or artillery drills, marching
and executing military movements with precision
that betokened much practice; or if not
on the parade grounds the young men were
to be seen in the steam launches, or else in the
shops. After drill hours till seven o'clock
four racing shells were out on the Severn
River. The athletic field was sure to be
crowded by baseball players; the tennis-courts
always had a waiting list. And far off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
on the superstructure deck of the "Nevada,"
unknown and unseen by other midshipmen,
were Robert Drake and four classmates, practicing
loading and aiming with a six-pounder
gun. Day after day this drill went on, always
in recreation times.</p>

<p>Robert took the shoulder-piece, finger on
trigger, keeping his gun aimed at some boat
moving in the Severn River. He was, according
to the prescribed gun drill, "First Pointer."</p>

<p>Peters was the "sight setter." He ran up
the rear sight according to the distance away
of the object aimed at, and also he would
move the rear sight to the right or left, according
to the speed the boat was moving.</p>

<p>Glassfell was loader, and as such acting gun
captain. Robert picked out two other classmates,
Taylor and Warren, to act as shell-men.</p>

<p>"All ready now, fellows," cried Glassfell,
late one beautiful April day; "let's have one
more drill to-night and then we'll knock off.
We'll start with the gun empty and breech
closed. Lenn, you throw down the breech as
usual after each make-believe shot&mdash;you won't
have to when we really fire the gun because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the gun is semi-automatic and the discharge
of one shot opens the breech, ready to load
the next one."</p>

<p>"I learned that years ago, Mr. Glassfell.
But I'll open the breech for you. We're all
ready, sir."</p>

<p>"Load," rang out Glassfell's voice. Down
went the breech, and instantly Glassfell threw
in a dummy cartridge, and up slammed the
breech, closing the gun with a click.</p>

<p>Robert snapped the trigger, and instantly
Lenn threw down the breech; the dummy
was ejected and Glassfell threw in another
cartridge. This was repeated again and
again, until Lenn called out "time."</p>

<p>"That was well done, sir; you loaded and
fired twenty-nine times in a minute; I kept
time; there wasn't a hitch. You have a well-trained
crew, Mr. Drake."</p>

<p>On the way back, Robert met Helen Blunt
walking with her brother. There was no
question but that Helen expected Robert to
stop and speak with her. She slackened her
pace a bit, bowing to Robert with a sort of
mute reproach in her manner; Robert hesitated
a moment, then turned and joined her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
while Harry Blunt walked on ahead, neither
he nor Robert giving any greeting.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Don't you and
Harry speak?" asked Helen, in a surprised,
hurt way.</p>

<p>"Midshipmen never seem to have time for
that sort of thing," said Robert, trying to
speak lightly. "Men of different classes seldom
speak unless they are particular friends.
Let's go down to the sea-wall, Helen, and
watch the shells; I do hope we'll win this
year; we ought to, we've splendid men on the
crew. What have you been doing lately? I
haven't seen you for an age, and there's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, whose fault is that?" interrupted
Helen with some spirit; "you bolted out of
the house the other night as though you
feared contagion, and I haven't seen you or
heard from you since. I should think you
would have something to tell me or explain."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Helen, I have ever so many
things I want to speak to you about," and
then Robert dropped into silence as they
walked along.</p>

<p>"We've been such friends," said Helen
quietly, "and had so many unforeseen things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
happen, that it seems as though we ought to
get along without any more misunderstandings
in the future; and yet we seem to be
having one now. You have suddenly stopped
coming to see me; surely there was a reason,
Robert; what was it?"</p>

<p>Robert felt supremely miserable and uncomfortable;
he did not know what to say.
There was a reason, and yet he could not tell
it to this sympathetic and congenial girl whose
friendship he was so anxious to keep; he
could not tell this reason, nor could he pretend
there was none. It would be no act of
kindness to Captain Blunt to inform him of
the unworthiness of his son. And so Robert
did not wish Helen to know that Harry was
in any way concerned with the matter Helen
wished to talk about.</p>

<p>"What's the reason, Robert?" repeated
Helen with her eyes full of interest and concern.</p>

<p>Just then, the far-away bell of the "Santee"
was struck four times. "Six o'clock," exclaimed
Robert; "we've a whole hour before
supper; let's walk along the sea-wall to College
Creek and back; we'll just have time to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
it." Poor Robert then relapsed into silence;
he was happy to be with his friend again and
eager to tell her that he could not explain his
peculiar conduct; but he could not talk.</p>

<p>His mind was in confusion, yet seemed a
blank; and the trivial things about him took
a prominence that in milder moods would
have remained unnoticed. He noted with
the eye of a naturalist a squirrel that scampered
across their path, and ran along the
fence, disappearing up a maple tree; two robins
were scolding and fussing in the tree top near
their nest. And from the coxswain of the
racing shell, out in the Severn River, came
regularly, like the tick-tock of a clock, the monotonous
words&mdash;"Stroke&mdash;Stroke&mdash;Stroke."
Thump, thump, thump went his heart.
"Stroke&mdash;Stroke&mdash;Stroke," called out the ruthless
coxswain to his tired crew on the river a
quarter of a mile away.</p>

<p>Robert did not know what to say. His
heart was so full he could not speak lightly.
Helen looked straight ahead and said nothing,
waiting no doubt for Robert to begin his explanation.
Each was intensely uncomfortable.
After Maryland Avenue was crossed, Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
turned to her companion and wistfully said:
"I thought you had so much to talk with me
about, Robert; but you haven't said a word.
What is the matter; are we not good friends?
Or is there some misunderstanding which prevents
our talking to each other?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Helen," cried he, "I'm awfully disturbed
about something. It is of such a
peculiar nature that I can't talk about it to
any one. Can't you trust me and not ask me
to explain myself? You see sometimes things
occur that a midshipman can't talk about&mdash;it
has nothing to do with any action of yours or
mine,&mdash;I think so much of your friendship
that it distresses me to appear as if I had any
other feeling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Robert, if you really are so anxious for
my friendship, what Naval Academy affair
could happen that would send you running
out of my house and that would prevent you
coming to see me?"</p>

<p>Then a great light broke upon her, and
stopping suddenly, she confronted Robert and
said excitedly:</p>

<p>"Robert Drake, I understand at last. You
saw Harry that night, after I left you in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
pantry. It was your duty, I suppose, to report
him and you didn't do so because of&mdash;of the
rest of us. And you haven't called since because
you are afraid you will see him again.
I'm right, I know I'm right!"</p>

<p>Robert looked helplessly at her, and then
said: "Helen, you and I have been good
friends, haven't we? And can't good friends
expect favors of one another? Now I've a
real favor to ask of you, and it's this. Don't
think of this matter, and please, oh, please,
don't talk about it. Don't talk about it to
your father and mother; I beg of you don't
refer to the matter in any way."</p>

<p>"Robert, I really will do as you want me
to, though I don't see why you have been so
much upset. Harry isn't Frenching any more;
he has promised me not to do that again. And
even if he should you will not know of it or
see him at my home; but I'm confident he
won't, now that he has given me his word.
Won't you come next Saturday and have
supper with us? And bring Mr. Stonewell
and Mr. Farnum with you."</p>

<p>Robert returned to his room in a happy
mood. He had worried much at how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Blunts would look upon his abrupt action,
and of his sudden avoidance of their home.
He had decided not to call so as to take no
chance of seeing Harry Blunt there, and he
knew he could never explain the reason of
his action to any of the Blunts. But now he
felt that Helen, in a way at least, understood;
she would require no further explanation and
would not gossip about his reasons. And also
he believed that Helen would so arrange it
that he would run no chance of seeing Harry
Blunt at her home when that young man had
no right to be outside of the Academy grounds.</p>

<p>And so Robert felt more light-hearted than
for many days, so much so that after supper,
while preparing for the next day's recitation,
Stonewell, who knew his roommate's every
mood, looked up smiling and said:</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, what is it; have you won the
flag ahead of time, or have you made up with
Helen Blunt? I've noticed you haven't been
going to her house much of late; and for
some time past you've been as glum as a
Russian bear."</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Stone, I'm just feeling
pretty fit, that's all."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten o'clock soon came, and with it out went
the lights in Bancroft Hall and a perfect stillness
broken only by the tread of midshipmen
making taps inspection. Soon this measured
tread ceased and complete silence reigned.</p>

<p>And then out of this profound stillness came
again that terrible cry, shrieked out in affright,
startling every midshipman in the armory
wing of Bancroft Hall. "Help! Help!" Far
away it first seemed, and yet it was plainly heard.</p>

<p>With lightning speed Stonewell leaped
from his bed and jumped into his clothes.</p>

<p>"Turn out, Bob," he cried. "I've a job to
do, and won't be with you; turn out everybody
in armory wing; tell Farnum to have
everybody fall in by companies on the ground
and first floors," and Stonewell dashed from
the room.</p>

<p>Again the weird shriek sounded, now heard
much plainer. Robert had followed Stonewell
out of the room, and ran down the corridor
shouting: "Turn out, everybody!
Company officers, get your companies together!"</p>

<p>Midshipmen from all the rooms poured into
the corridors.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Help, help, save me, save me!" in agonized
fearful tones were resounding throughout
the building. And these cries became clearer
on the lower floors. They seemed to have
started from above and to have come down
gradually.</p>

<p>"Help, help," rang out the cry, now apparently
on the first floor; it seemed to come
right from the midst of a throng of midshipmen
falling into their places in company
formation; these were entirely mystified.
And then the cry descended and was heard on
the floor below, the ground floor.</p>

<p>"Where is Stone?" asked Robert of
Farnum; "do you know where he went? He
said he had a job to do."</p>

<p>"I turned out when I heard that awful
yell," replied Farnum, "and I saw Stone run
down these stairs into the basement. I wonder
why he went down there."</p>

<p>Robert and Farnum were standing before
the first division of midshipmen in the
middle of the corridor, just in front of the
stairway that led to the basement. "Where
is Mr. Stonewell?" called the officer-in-charge,
Lieutenant-Commander Brooks; "look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
overhead in each corridor&mdash;what's that going
on on the stairway?" he suddenly exclaimed,
interrupting himself.</p>

<p>A midshipman was seen fairly running up
the dark stairway, dragging by the collar of
his coat another midshipman, who was vainly
endeavoring to regain his balance and foothold.</p>

<p>The first midshipman was Stonewell. In a
moment he had reached the head of the stairway,
and then, with a mighty effort, he
hurled his heavy burden from him.</p>

<p>"It's Bligh," cried out Robert.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Mr. Stonewell?"
demanded Lieutenant-Commander Brooks,
in wondering accents. Fourth Classman Bligh
presented a rueful, crestfallen figure. Stonewell
had handled him with no gentle force,
and at the head of the stairway had thrown
Bligh violently from him; and he now lay
in a heap on the floor. But evidently he was
not seriously injured, for he commenced to
sob convulsively.</p>

<p>Stonewell came up to Lieutenant-Commander
Brooks and quietly said: "Sir, some
time ago I thought I learned the source of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
mysterious cries we heard then and which
were repeated a few minutes ago. I went up
into the tower and saw a boatswain's chair in
the ventilating shaft which leads from the top
of the building to the basement. This boatswain's
chair was on a long rope which led
through a pulley block overhead, and by it a
man can lower himself from the top of the
building to the basement in the ventilating
shaft&mdash;I suppose it's there so that a person
can lower himself to make any repairs that are
needed in the shaft. When I heard the cry to-night
I ran to the basement&mdash;to the opening of
the ventilating shaft&mdash;and before long I could
see somebody coming down. I didn't know
who it was, but suspected it was Bligh, and it
was. He gave his last yell when he was even
with this floor. Then he lowered himself to
the bottom and I collared him just as he got
down."</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh was a pitiable spectacle. "It was
only a joke, sir," he gasped incoherently. "I
meant to do no harm, sir; it was just a little
fun. Mr. Stonewell had no occasion to use
me so roughly&mdash;he hurt me, sir."</p>

<p>"Go to my office immediately, sir," ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Lieutenant-Commander Brooks. "I will attend
to your case later. Mr. Stonewell, you
have done well, as usual. Dismiss the battalion,
turn everybody in, and have the usual
inspection made," and the officer-in-charge
left and returned to his office.</p>

<p>Fourth Classman Henry Bligh got up
slowly. He looked from face to face; not one
friendly expression did he find.</p>

<p>Full of pent-up feelings which he dared not
express Bligh turned and left.</p>

<p>"Dismiss the battalion, sir," ordered Cadet
Commander Stonewell to Cadet Lieutenant-Commander
Farnum.</p>

<p>"Companies are dismissed," rang out
through the corridor. "Go to your rooms
immediately and turn in. Company officers
make the usual taps inspection."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="center">STONEWELL RECEIVES A LETTER</p>


<p>When Henry Bligh became a midshipman
he was not at all a vicious young man. But
he arrived at Annapolis with an unformed
character. His predominating trait was a
desire for applause, and early in his fourth
class year his football ability had many times
earned for him vociferous applause. It was
his predominating desire, a passion to become
personally famous, that had urged him to give
the signal for the Gates forward pass when
playing against Harvard&mdash;the dishonor attached
to the act had not been clearly fixed
in his mind. The immediate result, his dismissal
from the football squad in disgrace, his
execration by the entire brigade of midshipmen&mdash;the
change of his position from one of
bright fame to contemptuous disesteem, had
immediate effect upon the unformed character
of Mr. Henry Bligh. He was plunged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the blackest of gloom and he brooded day and
night over his troubles.</p>

<p>It was a pity he had no close friend to talk
with, no older midshipman to be advised by.
Amongst the midshipmen there had been a
burst of anger against him and then he had
been left entirely alone.</p>

<p>No organized "coventry" was declared
against him, but a most effective, far-reaching
one existed. Its direct result was to make
Bligh continually unhappy, and this engendered
in him passionate anger. Anger must
find an object, and Bligh's directed its full
force upon Stonewell and Blunt. The former,
so he believed, had been the cause of all of his
troubles; the latter had supplanted him at
football, had defeated him in a personal fight.</p>

<p>On that first night when the midshipmen of
Bancroft Hall had been so startled by the
awful cry of "Save me," Bligh had been in the
basement; he heard the cries and found Farnum,
out of his head, seated in the boatswain's
chair at the bottom of the ventilating shaft.
Bligh of course immediately knew what had
happened, but he kept this knowledge to himself.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>On the night spoken of in the last chapter,
Bligh had been on the sick list, and therefore
was excused from company muster. It occurred
to him that he could perpetrate this
act and scare the hundreds of midshipmen
who had showered such contumelious treatment
upon him.</p>

<p>It really would have been a good joke had
it succeeded, but unfortunately for Bligh his
detection rendered his position almost unbearable.
He had been roughly treated by
Stonewell; and now whenever he passed a
cadet officer he was halted and given directions.</p>

<p>"Brace up, Mr. Bligh, put your heels together,
little fingers on the seams of your
trousers, chest out, belly in, head up, chin
in."</p>

<p>Had the joke been done by Glassfell or perhaps
any upper classman it would have been
laughed at. But to have been perpetrated by
a plebe was an indignity to time-honored midshipman
custom. And that the plebe should
have been Mr. Bligh made the act worse than
an indignity; it was an unbearable thought.
And so for a while Plebe Bligh figured on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
every delinquency conduct report. Cadet officers
suddenly discovered that Fourth Classman
Bligh's hair was too long, his clothes not
brushed, his shoes not shined. Bligh grew
nearly frantic, morning after morning, at hearing
such a report read out as:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Bligh, Wearing torn trousers at morning
inspection.</p>

<p>"Same, Soiled collar at same.</p>

<p>"Same, Not properly shaved at same."</p></blockquote>

<p>Bligh, much as he was to be blamed, really
was to be pitied. No midshipman was ever
more friendless, ever more in need of kindly
direction. Under some circumstances he
might have developed a useful character, a
high standard of thought and action. But in
his lonely life there was nothing but black,
bitter hopelessness. Bligh was in a state of
mind to yield to dark temptation if it presented
itself. Had his mental state been
known some one might have taken him in
hand and befriended him and directed his
thoughts to more wholesome subjects. But
Bligh made no advances to any one and in sad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
silence unknown and unthought of, brooded
tempestuously.</p>

<p>Beautiful May once more held dominion
over man and nature at Annapolis. For the
midshipmen there were studies, to be sure, but
the studies were all reviews of previous lessons
and therefore were easy. And then there
were drills, but these, this last month, were always
in the presence of hundreds of visitors
and therefore of particular interest to the midshipmen
drilling. Cadet Lieutenant Drake,
marching his company across the parade
ground, and giving in stentorian tones such
orders as:</p>

<p>"Squads right, full step, march," "Company
shoulder arms, double time march!" felt particularly
important in so doing, and thought
all eyes were on him; and little Fourth Classman
Mumma, handling a rifle instead of a
sword, and obeying instead of giving orders,
knew in his own mind that the people were
really looking at him, so he was filled with
pride and martial ardor; and so with all of the
rest of them.</p>

<p>And after drills were over the Academy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
grounds were thronged with midshipmen and
their friends, and the happiness ushered in at
Annapolis by every May seemed to enter all
hearts.</p>

<p>Robert Drake now frequently called at the
Blunt household and always found a warm
greeting there. Harry Blunt gladdened his
mother's heart by getting on the first conduct
grade, and so at times was to be seen in his
father's house on authorized liberty. Robert
never spoke to him, and though Helen
wondered why he should so cling to animosity
against her brother, and thought him unreasonable,
yet she contrived it that Robert and Harry
were never at the same time together in the
house.</p>

<p>"Bob," remarked Stonewell the next Sunday
morning, just after the commandant had
finished room inspection, "this is a glorious
day; what do you say to a ramble? Let's go
across the river and strike into the woods; I
know a trail through there, where the woods
are wonderfully thick; it will be beautiful to-day."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the path that leads by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
old chestnut trees, trees of enormous size and
now almost dead?" inquired Robert.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the place; those trees must be
hundreds of years old. Then wild flowers and
ferns will be out, all so fresh and lovely this
time of year. Don't you just long for the
woods when the spring-time comes?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do, Stone," cried Robert, "and
this will be a fine day for a stroll."</p>

<p>Soon the bugles rang out their call for
brigade formation and hundreds of midshipmen
rushed out on the terrace. Here the companies
were rapidly formed and then Cadet
Commander Stonewell came to an about face,
saluted and reported:</p>

<p>"Sir, the brigade is formed."</p>

<p>Upon this the commandant, accompanied
by a staff of officers and cadet officers, passed
in front of the long line, scanning each midshipman
closely, and corrected those who were
careless in dress. The ranks were then closed
and the brigade was marched to the chapel.</p>

<p>After service was concluded the midshipmen
were dismissed and Robert and Stonewell
went back to their rooms together.</p>

<p>In their absence mail had been distributed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and on the table in their room lay two letters,
one for Robert, the other for his roommate.</p>

<p>Robert's letter was from his father, and was
full of cheering home news, and it was eagerly
read by the young man.</p>

<p>"By George, Stone, father enjoys his work
with the Light House Board ever so much.
He says&mdash;&mdash;Why, Stone, old chap, what is
the matter?"</p>

<p>Stonewell was standing at the open window,
looking blankly across the waters of the
Chesapeake Bay. In his left hand, crushed,
was the letter he had just received. His face
was drawn, and in it Robert recognized an expression
he had seen but once before. Intense
apprehension and worry, perhaps fear, shone
from Stonewell's eyes. Apparently he was
oblivious to his roommate's question, for he
took no notice of it.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Stone?" again cried
Robert, rising from his chair, and going to his
roommate.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob, excuse me for not answering
your question&mdash;I was&mdash;I was thinking of
something else."</p>

<p>"But have you had bad news? You surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
have, Stone. Can't you talk it over with me?
Just think how much good you did me when
I had bad news."</p>

<p>Stonewell gave Robert a look of great affection
and said: "Thank you, old friend, there
is no one on earth I would talk with so quickly
as I would with you. And it may be that I
will want to talk something over with you
later, but just at present, Bob, there is nothing
I could say&mdash;you must excuse me." And with
that Stonewell picked up his hat and strode
from the room.</p>

<p>Robert was full of surprise and worry. It
was plainly evident that Stonewell was under
deep emotion, and just like him, he could not
or would not speak of the matter that so
affected him.</p>

<p>"I wish he would talk it over with me,"
thought Robert; "it always makes a fellow
feel better if he tells his worries to a true
friend. What a lot of times old Stone has
helped me in my troubles&mdash;and some of them
were big ones, too! When we take our walk
this afternoon I'll try to get him to tell me."</p>

<p>Robert now went out in the grounds,
thinking he might meet his roommate, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he did not, and as they sat at different mess
tables he had no chance to talk with Stonewell
until after dinner.</p>

<p>As soon as they were dismissed after dinner
Robert found his roommate, and said:</p>

<p>"Come along, Stone, let's start out right
away; it's a beautiful day and we'll have a
glorious ramble."</p>

<p>"Bob, I can't go; I find I have some letters
I must write; get somebody else to go with
you, old fellow&mdash;I wish I could go, but I
really can't."</p>

<p>Robert looked blankly at Stonewell. His
anticipations of a pleasant walk suddenly
vanished and the day seemed dreary. He
knew his roommate too well to try to expostulate
or argue with him.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, Bob," continued Stonewell,
laying an affectionate arm on Robert's
shoulder, and with real concern noticing
Robert's evident disappointment. "I do wish
I could go with you, but I really can't."</p>

<p>"I think I'll write some letters too," remarked
Robert in a dull, forlorn sort of way.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't waste this beautiful afternoon
that way!" said Stonewell; "why don't you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
get Helen to take a walk with you; she's
probably thinking you may call to-day."</p>

<p>"I'm going to write some letters," reiterated
Robert stolidly.</p>

<p>"Why, Bob, that's ridiculous; go out and
enjoy the day," urged Stonewell; "it will be
awfully tiresome remaining indoors all afternoon."</p>

<p>But Robert was as immovable as he knew
Stonewell to be; the latter seemed more
anxious for Robert to go out than the circumstances
called for.</p>

<p>In a few minutes both were in their room,
writing, and both ill at ease. As a matter of
fact neither wanted to write letters.</p>

<p>"Stone, I want you to tell me what has
been bothering you," Robert finally blurted
out. "You have helped me any number of
times and I have never done a thing for
you."</p>

<p>"You are constantly helping me, every
day," replied Stonewell; "you can have no
idea of how your opinion and regard for me
have kept me braced up. I know that my
course here at Annapolis is considered a successful
one; I know, Bob, you think I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
superior to you. Now I know I'm not; you
have qualities of steadfastness, of decision of
character that I can never hope for. I have
a certain faculty of quickly solving problems
that has given me my class rank, but, Bob, I
know you have qualities that will outlast
mine; and it is your attitude of mind toward
me that has kept me striving, and to you is
largely due the success I have won here. So
never again say you have not helped me.
You have been my constant inspiration.
Now, Bob, you think there is something on
my mind. If there is, it does not concern
myself, and I assure you I want to forget it;
and I cannot talk about it even with you.
But I promise you I will come immediately
to you if the slightest thing should arise in
which you could help me. So oblige me,
Bob, by dismissing this matter from your
mind."</p>

<p>Robert listened like one astonished. That
he could have been of such help to his roommate
he had never imagined and the thought
of it made him very happy.</p>

<p>"Bob," continued Stonewell with his rare
smile, "I'm sure Helen Blunt will be sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>prised
if you don't drop around to see her
this fine afternoon, and as that scamp of a
brother of hers is on the first conduct grade
it won't hurt if you see him at her home."</p>

<p>"All right, Stone," rejoined Robert,
cheerily. "I see you want to be alone and I
won't bother you any more; but I'm sorry
you're going to miss that stroll across the
river. I'm much obliged, old chap, if you
think I ever helped you; I never knew I had,
and I'm very happy at the thought. I think
I'll see if I can find Helen and persuade her
to take a walk."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="center">BLIGH MAKES A FRIEND</p>


<p>"Well, Robert Drake, I'm glad to see you;
I was hoping you might come over this afternoon,"
exclaimed Helen Blunt as Robert appeared
on the porch of her home; "suppose
we go out for a walk. I want to do an errand
for mother in Conduit Street; and then suppose
we walk over the bridge and go through
Eastport; there are some gorgeous woods beyond
there. Come along."</p>

<p>"That's just what I wanted to do," replied
Robert as they started off. "But did you
really expect me to-day? To tell you the
truth, Stonewell and I first intended to spend
the afternoon in the woods across the river,
but he found he had to write some letters, so
he decided not to go out to-day."</p>

<p>"So I come next after Stonewell, do I,
Robert?" queried Helen.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you where you stand&mdash;as one of
the best friends a fellow ever had," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Robert earnestly. "It is not a question of
standing next to Stonewell; he's just like a
big brother to me; do you know, Helen, he is
one of the most remarkable characters alive;
why, if he had studied law I believe he would
some day be President of the United States.
He excels in everything, and besides all that
he is just the best fellow imaginable."</p>

<p>"He is indeed a splendid, a most superior
man, Robert, but I believe Mr. Stonewell isn't
really as ambitious as you are, that he is more
influenced by your extravagant opinion of
him than he is by the abstract desire to excel
as a naval officer. You see it is so easy for
him to excel if he only half tries. But, Robert,
as much as I admire him, I do not feel that I
really know him. And come now, after rooming
with him for four years, do you feel you
know his intimate thoughts? Are you really
certain that you know Mr. Stonewell just as
he knows you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," Robert stoutly maintained.
"I know all about him. I know he's one of
the finest fellows that ever lived."</p>

<p>"And you know all about him, do you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he couldn't go walking with you to-day
because he had some letters to write?"</p>

<p>"That was the reason; but, Helen, it seems
to me you are asking some very odd questions."</p>

<p>"I know I am, but while we've been walking
down here, you have been looking this
way. Suppose you look around in the other
direction and tell me who you see walking at
such a rapid rate&mdash;I don't mean on Main
Street, but down Conduit Street, where we
will turn in a minute."</p>

<p>Robert did so, and to his intense surprise
saw Stonewell. The latter evidently had not
seen Helen or her companion. He was swinging
down Conduit Street with rapid strides,
perhaps a hundred yards ahead of them.
Robert was so amazed that he could say nothing.
It was now evident to him that Stonewell
had received news of some nature that
caused him to break his engagement to go
walking, news that brought him in this great
hurry on Conduit Street, a part of Annapolis
not much frequented by midshipmen; and
news that he certainly did not care to discuss
with his most intimate friend.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now what do you think of that, Mr.
Robert?" cried Helen triumphantly. "He
broke his engagement to write some letters,
and as soon as you leave he rushes out to
Conduit Street. There, he's gone into that
big yellow house. Now, do you think you
know as much about Mr. Stonewell as he does
about you?"</p>

<p>Robert was silent. He too thought it was
queer. He was too loyal in his friendship to
Stonewell to tell Helen of the misgivings he
had felt since he had seen his roommate so
affected by that morning letter. And Stonewell's
action now was decidedly mystifying.
Robert instinctively knew his roommate was
in deep trouble and he longed to know of the
burden upon him and to share it with him.</p>

<p>"Do forgive me, Robert," said Helen a little
later, noticing how sober he had become. "I'm
awfully sorry I called your attention to Mr.
Stonewell; I know how devoted you are to
your friends. Let's try and forget about it
and be happy. We'll go into the woods and
gather some violets and dogwood&mdash;the woods
are so pretty now&mdash;full of moss and ferns&mdash;let's
walk fast."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert was cheered up a bit, and when they
had finished their errand on Conduit Street
they hastened to the woods. Leaving their
troubles behind them, these young people
were soon in a happy, merry mood. The
woods were soon deep about them, and they
drank deep breaths from the forest-perfumed air.
Robert told Helen the great secret of his gun
drill and the means he had taken to win the flag.</p>

<p>"And, Helen, if my company wins it I am
going to ask you to present it; if we win it
that will be my privilege."</p>

<p>Helen was enthusiastic, of course, for the
greatest glory a girl ever wins at Annapolis is
to be chosen to present the colors to the winning
company.</p>

<p>"You'll win it, I'm sure you will," she
cried; and then, woman-like, she immediately
became deeply pensive.</p>

<p>"Why so quiet?" queried Robert.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was thinking about what kind of a
dress I shall wear, and I must have a new hat
too,&mdash;I'm sure you'll win, Robert, just as sure
as though it had really happened."</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Bligh continued to lead, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
crowded community of light-hearted young
men, a solitary life. He commenced to experience
a certain kind of cruel pleasure in
being the martyr he considered himself to be.
Calm though he outwardly was his mind was
in a continual ferment, with a direct result
that he was never in a humor to study;
naturally he did poorly in his daily recitations
and worse in examinations. The time
for the annual examinations was now near and
Bligh knew he had but little hope of passing.
Only by heroic effort could he hope to make a
satisfactory mark for his final average and
thus become a third classman. Bligh was in
no mental state to make this required heroic
effort. In fact it was practically certain
that he would fail and be required to resign.</p>

<p>One Saturday in the middle of May, Bligh
went out in the city of Annapolis and walked
around in an aimless way. He wandered in
the State House grounds and finally sat down
on an iron bench near the statue of Chief
Justice Taney.</p>

<p>After a few minutes he observed a young
man approach on the walk that led by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
bench. Bligh gave him a careless glance, and
as the young man passed he happened to look
at him again. And then a startling change
came over Mr. Henry Bligh. His eyes seemed
to bulge from their sockets; involuntarily he
half arose from his seat; his breath came in
quick gasps; he gave every evidence of complete
amazement. Then he suddenly sank
back, relaxed and gave himself over to uncontrolled
merriment.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a joke," he cried; "oh, my, oh,
my!&mdash;who would believe it?"</p>

<p>It had been long since Bligh had laughed
so heartily. And it was strange indeed, because
there was nothing particularly remarkable
in the appearance of the young man who
had so affected Bligh. He was dressed in a well
made gray suit and wore a straw hat. His
features were undeniably handsome. He had
a broad forehead, and under heavy eyebrows
there gleamed a pair of thoughtful gray eyes;
he was tall and powerfully built, and walked
with a swinging gait. Before the civilian had
gone far, Bligh arose, in a hesitating way, and
half-heartedly followed him. The stranger
walked around State House Circle into Main
Street, and turned down that street; Bligh followed.
Soon he apparently gathered courage
and drew nearer to the man ahead. The latter
went into a drug store, stopped at the fountain
and seemingly ordered a summer drink.
Bligh had a good look at him through the
open door, pausing there for a moment; then
he went inside and stood by the counter and
ordered an orange phosphate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;">
<img src="images/i003.png" width="477" height="700" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>HE HALF AROSE FROM
HIS SEAT</i></span></span>
</div>

<p>"It's a good cooling drink for warm
weather," he observed to the young man on
his right, looking squarely at him.</p>

<p>"Indeed it is," replied that person, looking
at Bligh with friendly interest; "but try a lime
phosphate some time; the West Indian lime
is very cooling."</p>

<p>"I will," replied Bligh heartily. "You're
a stranger here, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I see you are a midshipman.
I've heard lots about the Naval Academy; it's
a fine place, isn't it? I imagine midshipmen
live a most interesting life."</p>

<p>"Some do, I suppose; I know others who
don't. Some fellows here make a false start,
slip up on something, you know, and get in a
bad light, and after that they have no chance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a><br /><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
everybody gets down on them." Bligh spoke
bitterly.</p>

<p>"That's pretty hard luck," observed the
stranger; "my sympathy always goes to a fellow
in that fix. Even if he does slip up once
there may be lots of good left in him, and a
man should not be utterly condemned for one
mistake. That isn't fair at all. If I had to
choose a friend between two men, one of whom
had been careless in some act and acknowledged
it, and the other was of the I-am-better-than-thou-class,
I'd take the first fellow for a
friend every time. But my thoughts can
hardly interest you,&mdash;I don't suppose they apply
to you at all," and the speaker turned a
thoughtful, penetrating glance upon Bligh.</p>

<p>Tears suddenly gushed from Bligh's eyes,
and in a broken voice he said: "See here,
you are the first man that has spoken to me in
a friendly way for months."</p>

<p>Bligh showed genuine emotion and feeling
when he spoke. He was totally friendless,
and he suddenly felt great pity for himself.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear fellow," exclaimed his
newly-made acquaintance, "you will pardon
me for my inadvertent remarks&mdash;but suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
we take a walk; come over to my rooms, and if
you feel like it talk things over with me&mdash;I
don't know you, but I want to know you. I
don't believe I see anything bad in your face,
though I imagine there is sadness there."</p>

<p>These kind words were to Bligh like heaven-sent
manna. Until this moment he had no
conception of how he yearned for just one
single friend, one person who believed there
was good in him, one to whom he could open
his heart and pour out its griefs. Instantly
this newly-made friendship became precious,
and he felt brighter and happier than he had
for months. Sincerity and kindness were
written in the features of this new friend.</p>

<p>Bligh spent several hours with him in his
rooms, and acquainted him with the troubles,
mistakes and heartburnings that were his
daily portion in his now unfortunate condition;
in doing this he saw himself in a new
light; and now when his new friend pointed
out where he was blameworthy, where he had
been wrong, he eagerly assented. For this
grave friend, sympathetic though he was to
the sad story that rushed from Bligh's lips,
in a kindly spirit severely criticized Bligh for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
his wrong actions. He laughed heartily at
Bligh's woeful story of how he had lowered
himself in the ventilating shaft. "That was
good, Mr. Bligh," he said; "but it's a great
pity that you were caught."</p>

<p>When Bligh returned to his quarters he
was like a different man; more happiness to
his wounded spirit had come to him this day
than he had had for months.</p>

<p>"If I had only had a friend like this when
the year commenced," he reflected, "my life
here would have been different. But now I'm
afraid it's too late; I'm pretty sure to bilge."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="center">AN ILL-FAVORED, RED-BEARDED ROGUE</p>


<p>"Bob, I think I've got the flag this year,"
remarked Cadet Lieutenant Blair, to his fellow
three striper, Robert Drake; "everybody
says my company is better than yours in
artillery; I've an even chance with you at
infantry&mdash;members of my company have had
part in baseball and football games, fencing,
rowing, tennis, gymnasium and all other contests.
The second company, I think, will get
the most points in seamanship, and I have
more trained marksmen than you have. I've
got you beaten, Bob, old boy."</p>

<p>"Don't you be too sure of that, Sam; the
first company has a notion it wants to carry
the colors next year; and look here, Sam,
I'll put you on to something if you'll agree to
keep quiet about it."</p>

<p>"What is it, Bob? I'll keep mum," replied
Blair expectantly, impressed by Robert's
earnest manner.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"The first company is going to try to win
the flag, and I'm going to spring a big surprise
on you."</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Is that your news? Perhaps I'll
spring a surprise on you."</p>

<p>"Go ahead if you can, Sam, but I warn you
now that I have done something toward
winning the flag that you don't know anything
about. It's in line with advice that was
given to all of us months ago, and what I've
done is perfectly proper and legitimate. I'll
tell you frankly that because of special preparation
I have made, I expect the first company
will have a higher final multiple than your
company will have."</p>

<p>"What was the advice you refer to, Bob? I
don't recall any."</p>

<p>"By the way, haven't you been doing some
special stunts in seamanship? Haven't some
old boatswain's mates been giving your men
some extra drill in handling sail?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, Bob; if I have
done special work in seamanship I'm not
bound to tell you what it is. But what was
the advice you spoke of?"</p>

<p>"Sam, we'll be on the square with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
other. I learned accidentally that you were
getting specially coached in seamanship; well,
I'm doing special work in gunnery. It's a
fair field and no favor, and may the best company
win."</p>

<p>"Good. Some of the fellows have been
figuring up the points already known to be
credited to the different companies; more than
half of the points are already made, you
know, and as it happens both the first and
second companies are so far pretty close together;
we're within ten points of each other
to-day and no other company is within
twenty points of either of us. Either you or
I will win the flag, that is certain. And, Bob,
if you win it I'm going to lead the cheering
for the winning company."</p>

<p>"I appreciate that sentiment, Sam, and if
you win the flag I will lead the cheering."</p>

<p>"Say, Bob, have you read about that kidnapping
case in Baltimore? Some rascals have
stolen a little boy named Georgie Thompson."</p>

<p>"No, I hadn't. Jingo! I hope they catch
the scoundrels and get the boy back."</p>

<p>The two young men shook hands in the
heartiest fashion and separated. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
intense personal rivalry between them, far
more than their words expressed; it was a
commendable rivalry; each was determined
to make every effort to win the great prize,
but each had a high personal regard for the
other.</p>

<p>This meeting was on one of the Saturdays
in May. Robert was now highly elated with
the efficiency of his six-pounder crew. It
drilled every day. Dummy six-pounder
shells were thrown into the gun with tremendous
speed and remarkable precision.
There were now no slips, no jams. While
this was proceeding Robert would be at the
shoulder-piece, his eye at the peep-sight, aiming
at some boat in the river. This was the
nearest approach possible to actually firing
the gun. And every man of the gun's crew
was enthusiastically confident.</p>

<p>"Stone," said Robert, after dinner this
Saturday, "I've permission to use a steamer
this afternoon and I've got up a party to go
up the Severn River."</p>

<p>"I'll bet Helen is in the party," replied
Stonewell, smiling at his roommate.</p>

<p>"Of course she is; Mrs. Blunt is coming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and Glassfell and Farnum. Now we want
you too."</p>

<p>"I wish I could go, but I can't," replied
Stonewell, decidedly. "I've an engagement I
can't break."</p>

<p>"Oh, rats, chuck your tailor for once&mdash;your
measure will keep. But now I'll give
you some information that will bring you
along with us&mdash;Nellie Strong is with the
Blunts; she arrived this morning and is
going to stay over for graduation. Now will
you come?"</p>

<p>"I can't, Bob, but I'll be out to the Blunts'
house to-night."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, I counted on your going&mdash;what is
your engagement; can't you put it off?"</p>

<p>"I really wish I could, but it's imperative;
there's nothing pleasant about it&mdash;I may tell
you about it later&mdash;I can't now."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you've been getting an extra
lot of letters lately, Stone."</p>

<p>"Yes, more than I wish for," rejoined
Stone rather bitterly.</p>

<p>"Helen and I went walking that Sunday
afternoon, the Sunday you and I had intended
going across the river. First Helen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
had an errand to do on Conduit Street and
right ahead of us you were walking along.
You went into a big yellow house."</p>

<p>Stonewell gave a start. "Well," he said,
"what of it?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Stone, old chap, you have
something on your mind that's bothering you
terribly. Is there no way I can help you;
will it do you no good to talk things over
with me?"</p>

<p>"Bob, I can't talk; I don't pretend I'm not
worried, but I just can't unburden my mind,
not even to the best friend a man ever had,"
replied Stonewell huskily, with almost a
break in his voice. He walked away
from his roommate with agitated face,
and gloomily looked out upon the waters
of Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>Loud were the expressions of disappointment
from Robert's friends when he told
them Stonewell could not join them on their
trip. They all got aboard the steam launch,
which immediately started up the Severn
River; the day was pleasant and all were in
high spirits. The Severn River is most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>picturesque in its scenery. High, densely-wooded
banks, irregular in outline, line its
shores, and there are many indentations of
little bays that lead into the river. Three
miles above its mouth the Severn widens into
Round Bay, a sheet of water several miles in
diameter. And above this and emptying into
it is a narrow stream, which is still called
Severn River.</p>

<p>The launch steamed through Round Bay,
and then entered this narrow stream. "Isn't
this beautiful?" cried Robert. "Just look at
this winding little river; I wonder how far up
we can go. Say, coxswain, how far up this
river can we steam?"</p>

<p>"If I knew the channel I could take you up
to Indian Landing, sir," answered the coxswain;
"some of our steamers have been up that far;
but I don't know the channel, sir; I'm afraid
we'll go aground at any minute."</p>

<p>"Well, can't you follow that gasoline launch
ahead of us? The fellow in it probably knows
the channel."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I can do that."</p>

<p>A covered gasoline launch was a quarter of
a mile ahead. "Give me all the speed you
can," called out the coxswain to the engineer;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
"I want to catch that boat ahead; this river has
so many little turns that I'll have to keep
close to that chap ahead." The engineer of
the launch turned on a steam jet in the smokestack
to force the draft and the little boat instantly
responded and made a great fuss in
increasing the speed of the engine.</p>

<p>"Why don't we catch up?" asked Robert,
in a few minutes; "we are surely going much
faster than we were."</p>

<p>"Because he has nearly doubled his speed,
Mr. Drake," replied the coxswain.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, it's a race!" shouted the midshipman;
"now let's see who will win."</p>

<p>The steam launch commenced to gain on
the gasoline boat. The coxswain had been
looking at the latter through a pair of binoculars;
after a time he quietly remarked to
Robert, "This isn't a race, sir; those men in
the boat ahead of us think we are chasing
them, and if I ever saw a pair of precious
rogues in my life I'm looking at them now.
Take a look at them, Mr. Drake."</p>

<p>"Well, no one would ever say they were
pretty," remarked Robert after a good look at
them through the glasses. "We are catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>ing up with them now. Hello, they've
stopped."</p>

<p>In a short time the steam launch was
abreast of the gasoline boat. In the latter but
one man was to be seen, and an ill-favored
man he was.</p>

<p>"My! What a brutal-looking fellow," remarked
Nellie Strong with a shudder.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded the man,
in a surly, sullen way.</p>

<p>"We were stealing pilotage from you, that's
all," replied Robert. "We're going up this
river and don't know the channel and are
afraid of going ashore. Is there danger of
that if we keep in the middle of the stream?"</p>

<p>"I hope you'll strike a shoal and stay
there till the crack of doom. You've no
business to go running after another boat that
way."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" called out
Robert; "and why don't your two friends
show themselves? It looks to me as if you're
afraid of the police."</p>

<p>The man made an angry exclamation and
the steamer passed ahead. "What an ill-tempered
man," said Helen Blunt to Robert;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
"I wish he'd cut off that red beard of his; he
wouldn't look so much like a pirate then."</p>

<p>"We won't worry about that fellow. Now
I'm going up in the bow with a boat-hook to
take soundings; we'll run slow and keep right
in the middle of the river. But isn't it beautiful
around here. Just look how the little
river twists and winds about and how irregular
the shore is; and there are lots of little
creeks running into the river and little bays
stretching out from it."</p>

<p>"And isn't it lonely?" rejoined Helen.
"There is hardly a house or a clearing to be
seen; it's a regular wilderness."</p>

<p>Robert went to the bow of the steamer, and
taking a boat-hook thrust it in the water;
it was quite deep enough, so he felt reassured
about the boat's not going ashore.</p>

<p>"There's Indian Landing ahead of us,"
called out the coxswain. "I don't think we
had better go much further; we've got eleven
miles to run before we get back, and I'm
afraid of getting low in coal."</p>

<p>"All right, put aback and return." And
soon the steamer was headed down the river.</p>

<p>"Where's that gasoline boat; can you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
her anywhere?" asked Robert, a few moments
later.</p>

<p>"No, sir, we would have met her by this
time if she had followed straight up the river.
And that's odd, too. Indian Landing is the
only place boats ever come to up here&mdash;she
must be hidden in one of those lonely
creeks."</p>

<p>"That's it, I imagine. There's something
queer about that boat; it certainly had three
ugly-looking men in it, and two of them
didn't want to be seen. That bearded chap
was a fierce-looking specimen."</p>

<p>"Say, Bob," called out Glassfell from aft,
"mess gear is spread and we're waiting for
you to pipe us to dinner, but we won't wait
long&mdash;you'd better get here in a hurry."</p>

<p>Robert lost no time and immediately joined
the others. An attractive lunch had been
spread and was now attacked with energy; in
the launch was a party of good friends, all in
gay spirits. The day was delightful and
when they finally reached the "Santee" wharf
and left the launch it was unanimously
agreed that a most enjoyable afternoon had
been spent.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Early this afternoon Stonewell left his
room, and unaccompanied went out in the
city of Annapolis. He walked rapidly and
before long was in Conduit Street, and without
stopping to wait for admittance, entered a
large yellow house. Two hours later he left
and hastened to a telegraph office.</p>

<p>But Stonewell was not the only visitor that
day who entered this large yellow house on
Conduit Street. For at about eight o'clock
that evening a man in civilian garb, wearing
a moustache and heavy pointed beard, with a
brown slouch hat drawn low over his forehead,
and in closely buttoned sack coat, went
to the same house, and without hesitation,
opened the door by a pass key and passed inside.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="center">AN OLD COLORED MAN IS IN TROUBLE</p>


<p>A hop was given that Saturday night at
the Armory. There was nothing particularly
noteworthy about this hop; it was just like
hundreds of its predecessors. As usual, near
graduation time, there were many out
of town visitors, and it is likely that brass
buttons proved attractive to them. Many
glad faces were to be seen whirling around,
and judging by the happy laughs that were
heard everyone was having a jolly time.</p>

<p>Robert Drake had escorted an old friend
that night, Miss Nellie Strong. He had seen
her card filled up, had presented her partners,
and had taken three numbers himself.</p>

<p>"Something is always happening to you,
Robert," remarked Nellie as they walked
around the room after the second dance.
"Now tell me what misadventure you have
had this year."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not one, Nellie; my bad luck is all over;
not one single unpleasant thing has happened
to me since I became a first classman."</p>

<p>"What was the occasion of that remarkable
disappearance of yours a year ago? Surely
you can tell me now; I've never been so
curious over anything in my life."</p>

<p>"I've never told anybody about that,
neither my father nor Stonewell nor Helen
nor anybody else."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare! I don't suppose it
amounted to much, anyway. And perhaps
you think you're more interesting if you're
mysterious. Now, Mr. Robert, tell me something
else; why wasn't Harry Blunt with us
this afternoon? I asked him and he said
you hadn't invited him. Don't you like
him, Robert? I think Harry is a nice boy."</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about Harry Blunt.
Let's talk about his sister. Helen is a very
good friend of mine, and her father is one of
the finest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Robert," suddenly interrupted Nellie,
"something is going to happen to you again&mdash;that
colored man in the doorway motioned
to you; just look at him, he's motioning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
you now; he wants to speak to you,&mdash;oh, I
just knew something would happen to you."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. That's old Grice. He's a great
old chap. He just wants to see me about
something&mdash;I'll take you to where Mrs.
Blunt is and then go see what he wants."</p>

<p>"What is it, Grice?" asked Robert to the
old man at the door, a moment later.</p>

<p>"Sompin' powerful bad, Mistah Drake; I'se
feared to talk heah. Can yo' come outside,
suh? I'se somef'n mighty bad to tell yo',
suh!"</p>

<p>The old darkey shook his head and rolled
his eyes, making a grotesque effort to express
the worried feelings evidently in his mind.</p>

<p>"Come outside, but hurry. I'm here with
some young ladies, and I haven't much time
to talk with you."</p>

<p>"No, suh, co'se not. And dem young ladies
am pow'ful nice, suh."</p>

<p>"Well, Grice, what is it that you want with
me?"</p>

<p>"Well, suh, I doan' know how to tell it. Yo'
knows I'se messenger for department of mathmax,
doan' yo', Mistah Drake?"</p>

<p>"Of course; what of it?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mistah Drake, suh, will yo' gibe me yor
promise as a naval officer an' gemman that yo'
won' tell anybody what I'se gwine to say?"</p>

<p>"No, of course I won't."</p>

<p>"Well, suh, a big crime is goin' to be cormitted.
An' a pore ole niggah man knows
about it an' goes to a young gemman frend of
hizn and asks fo' help and can't get none.
And the pore ole niggah will be accused an'
go to jail. Won' yo' help me, Mistah Drake?
Won' yo' help a pore ole niggah what's in
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will, Grice, but I'm not going
to promise you to keep secret what you tell
me."</p>

<p>"Ef yo' goes roun' talking 'bout what I tells
yo' no one will believe me. I'll be bounced,
suh, after thirty years heah, an' ef yo' doan'
help me a crime will be cormitted and folks
will say ole Grice done it. Ain't yo' gwine to
help me, Mistah Drake?"</p>

<p>Robert thought for a moment, looking intently
at the old negro. The latter talked
with great effort. Beads of perspiration burst
out on his face. It was evident that Grice was
in terror of losing his all and knew not what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to do. "Grice, I'll help you if I can," said
Robert. "If what you tell me is important I
will talk about it to the commandant and to no
one else. Now what is it? Be quick."</p>

<p>"Thank yo', suh. Two midshipmen is
a-gwine to steal the mathmax zamnation. I
wuz sleepin' in the mathmax room last night.
My ole woman an' I done hav' a disregard
'bout religion yesterday; she's Zion Baptis'
an' I'se Asbury Methodis'. We disregarded so
hard that I didn't go home las' night,&mdash;co'se
'tain't allowed to sleep in mathmax room, but
I done it las' night; well, suh, Mistah Drake,
suh, suah as yo' is bawn, suh, it woke me up.
Two men came in the mathmax room. The
doors wuz all locked; I done that myself;
they mus' have had a key made. They come
to the desk were the zamnation questions is
kep'. They had a light&mdash;turned it on, and
put somfin' in the key bob of the desk, I seen
'em do it, suh. This morning I fin' wax in
keyhole. Zamnations ain't made out yet, but
these gemmen will come back with the keys
and steal the zamnation&mdash;den ole Grice will
be 'cused and dismissed&mdash;zamnations have
been stolen befoah, Mistah Drake, yo' knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
it, suh, an' money stolen, an' gen'ally some
pore niggah gets dismissed an' half de time it's
some pore white trash in midshipman close
what does it. Yes, suh, an' &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you see the faces of these midshipmen,
Grice?" interrupted Robert.</p>

<p>"Yes, suh. I done had a good luk at 'em."</p>

<p>"Who were they?"</p>

<p>"Foah de Lawd sake, Mistah Drake, doan'
yo' ask me no such questionings," cried out
Grice in affrighted tones.</p>

<p>"Do you know the names of those two midshipmen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, suh, Mistah Drake, suh, but I ain't
a-gwine to say who they is; ef I tole yo' who
they is they would tole yo' Grice prevaricated
and Grice would be dismissed. No, suh, I
ain't a-gwine to tole yo' who they is, Mistah
Drake, suh; yo' done got to catch 'em, suh."</p>

<p>"Grice, I shall tell the commandant what
you have told me and he will make you tell
him who they are."</p>

<p>"I disremember their names, suh," suddenly
replied Grice. "I forgets their names, but I
knows 'em; they is midshipmen. Now, Mistah
Drake, suh, they will come back, suah they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
will, suh, an' yo' an' me will be in the mathmax
room and catch 'em."</p>

<p>"All right, Grice, I'll help you; but I've
got to go now. Call on me if anything new
turns up," and Robert returned to the ballroom
and soon was with Helen Blunt.</p>

<p>"Robert," she said after a few minutes,
"we're awfully worried about Harry; he's
been dropping in mathematics and is officially
warned that he is in danger of failing at
the annual examination. Do you think he
will fail?"</p>

<p>"There's but little danger of that, Helen;
don't worry; lots of his classmates have been
warned and your brother is really bright.
He would have high class rank if he studied,
and he always does fairly well in examinations.
I saw his name posted at the beginning
of this month, but you needn't worry;
he probably has been boning and no doubt
will pass."</p>

<p>"Won't you help him, Robert?" asked
Helen in wistful tones; "you know what a terribly
sad thing it is to a naval family to have
a son fail at Annapolis."</p>

<p>"Wherever and whenever I can. Just bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
on that; but your brother and I are not
friendly and I'm quite sure he would disdain
any help from me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Robert, what did that old colored man
want?" cried Nellie Strong, running up.</p>

<p>"Oh," laughed Robert, "he wanted to know
who that powerfully pretty girl was that I was
with. He said she was the nicest girl on the
floor. And then he wanted to know who
made that crepe de chine gown you are wearing
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Robert Drake, stop your nonsense, and
tell me what that old man wanted," cried
Nellie, consumed with curiosity; "are you in
some more trouble; are you going to disappear
again?"</p>

<p>"What is it, Robert; has anything happened?"
inquired Helen, much concerned.</p>

<p>"Nothing much; an old colored man, Grice,
who is the sweeper and cleaner of the mathematical
department, is in trouble and wanted
my advice and help. You see his wife is a
Zion Baptist and he's an Asbury Methodist,
something like that, and they have 'disregards,'
so Grice tells me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p><p>"Oh, I know old Harriet Grice," interrupted
Helen. "She used to cook for us
when father was commandant, and every
night when she went home she carried with
her everything left in the pantry and ice-box.
Once when I caught her in the act she said
she was taking the stuff to the Zion Church;
that it wasn't stealing because she was giving
it to the Lord. She and old Grice have terrible
rows, in spite of their both being so religious."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed and Nellie Strong was
satisfied. Then the music started. "This is
ours, Nellie," remarked Robert, and in a moment
the two were lost in the crowd.</p>

<p>The next morning after chapel service,
Robert spent half an hour with the commandant
and related what Grice had told
him.</p>

<p>"I'll send for Grice to-morrow," said that
officer, "but I doubt if he will disclose the names
of the midshipmen, even if he really does know
them. These darkeys are remarkably stubborn
when they once get a notion in their
woolly heads. If Grice is telling a true story
we must certainly catch the offenders in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
act." The commandant thought for a moment
and then continued: "I could post
some watchmen about the place, but then the
guilty persons might take alarm. If Grice's
story is true there is surely a bad pair of midshipmen
here, and we must get them and dismiss
them."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="center">THE KIDNAPPERS</p>


<p>Annapolis was full of excitement. It always
is at this time of year, and though the
town is old, and though graduation scenes
have been rehearsed for more than sixty years,
still the play is always fresh; young lives are
about to go out and do their battle in the
world, and friends come to applaud them and
to spend a few days with them, and to wish
them Godspeed. And so visitors by thousands
poured into the ancient city; and the
young men of Robert Drake's class had a
sense of great importance because it was all to
do honor to their graduation, now but a few
weeks off.</p>

<p>But it wasn't only at the Naval Academy
that important matters were happening at this
time; for near Annapolis, events were occurring
of tremendous import to a few people,
and particularly so to a small, white-faced
whimpering boy, seven years old.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Up the Severn River, some little distance
before it reaches Round Bay, was an offshoot
from the river. This offshoot, a small creek,
by devious windings led through a desolate,
untenanted, uncultivated, roadless region.
Once, in the heyday of slavery, prosperous
tobacco fields existed where now there was a
dense second growth of trees crowded by a
tangled underbrush impenetrable to man unless
armed with a hatchet. Here, through an absolute
wilderness, inhabited only by coons, squirrels
and hares, the little offshoot to the Severn
took its unmolested way. No Man's Creek it
was called, and well named it was. Not even
isolated negroes' cabins were to be seen on its
banks, and wild duck in their season, unmolested
by the gun, here found a secure
place.</p>

<p>But, completely hidden in this creek, disturbing
visitors had recently appeared. In
one of the sharp turns of No Man's Creek, and
completely hidden from view, was a covered
gasoline launch. In it were three men and a
small, weeping boy.</p>

<p>"We'll start to-night at eleven; it will be
dark then, the moon sets at nine; and I'll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
glad to have the thing over with. Jingo! I
wish we had never done this thing," said one
of them, a red-bearded man of uncertain age.
"I'm sure no one followed us to Indian Landing;
we landed there at a time when nobody
was awake. But it was a hard trip from there
across lots to this place. I never would have
found this spot if I weren't so well acquainted
about here. But I wish we could have got
out last night&mdash;confound that leaky gasoline
tank&mdash;it dished us at the last moment. But
we'll be out to-night sure&mdash;it will take us an
hour to run by the Naval Academy, and two
hours later we'll be across the bay and in Kent
Island&mdash;once there I'll be easy in my mind;
we'll be absolutely safe. And then we'll get
ten thousand for our trouble. Stop your crying,
Georgie, we're taking you to your father.
Hello, Jim, what's that noise? I hear a man
shouting!"</p>

<p>The red-bearded man jumped up and out
of the boat; he ran up a bank and returned
in a moment. "We're caught," he cried
hoarsely; "somebody has seen us and has
given us away. We'll have to leave instantly&mdash;cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>the painter! Hurry, start the engine&mdash;shove
off the boat; we haven't a moment to
lose!"</p>

<p>With zeal born of fear and desperation, the
three men worked frantically, and very soon
the gasoline boat was chugging down the
stream. And none too soon, for two men
now standing near where the gasoline boat
had been secured were shouting for them to
return. With pallid faces the three men confronted
one another.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Let's land somewhere on Round Bay
shore, turn the kid adrift and run," ventured
a second one. "We'll be caught in this boat;
our only hope is to separate and each of us
try to get away by himself."</p>

<p>"We'll do nothing of the kind," retorted
the red-bearded man; "we will stick to this
boat; we'll follow the original programme.
What chance would I have? That chap saw
me plainly and everybody in six counties
would look for a man with red whiskers. No,
sir! Those two men are left on the shore;
they are miles from a telephone; we'll be halfway
across Chesapeake Bay before they can
communicate with anybody, and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
so many launches in the Severn River that
we won't be noticed. That's the only thing
to do, fellows."</p>

<p>"It's twenty years in prison if we're
caught," remarked one with a gasp.</p>

<p>"Stop your sniveling! Cheer up! We'll
be on the Eastern Shore to-night, and once
there I defy anybody to find us."</p>

<p>These three men were the kidnappers of
little Georgie Thompson. Seemingly their
plans had been perfectly laid. Two of them
had driven from Baltimore in a roundabout
way to a place near Indian Landing, arriving
there at night. One of these, with Georgie,
had stolen that same night to where the gasoline
launch had been brought by the third
man. The other had gone further on and
turned adrift the horse and buggy they had
driven from Baltimore and joined the launch
later. Had it not been for the loss of the
gasoline the boat would already have been on
the other side of Chesapeake Bay. More
gasoline had been secured, and this cowardly
trio had determined to wait until dark before
leaving their hiding-place.</p>

<p>The gasoline launch shot out of No Man's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Creek and swung into the Severn River.
Soon Round Bay was reached and the launch
struck across the centre of it and, keeping at
equal distance from either shore, ran down
the river at full speed. They attracted no
notice on their way and soon the railroad
bridge was passed, then the county bridge
and they were abreast of the Naval Academy
grounds. No passing boats seemed at all interested
in their movements, and the men felt
easier. In but a short time they would be
out of the river and on their way across
Chesapeake Bay. Hardly a word had been
spoken on this fast trip down the river, but
desperate fear gripped each man's heart.
Little Georgie was now crying softly; he did
not realize what was happening, did not comprehend
what these strange men were doing
beyond their statement that they were taking
him to his father, but they were a long time
about it and he was hungry and uncomfortable.
There was something terrifying in it
all to the little boy and now and again he
would sob bitterly.</p>

<p>When opposite the lower part of the Naval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>Academy grounds the gasoline engine suddenly
stopped. With a fierce exclamation of
fear and rage the red-bearded man jumped to
the engine and tried to start it again, but with
no success.</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be all right here,"
he said in a low, intense way; "the spark is
all right,"&mdash;then in a voice of fright he said,
"This cock doesn't show there is any gasoline
in the feed pipe; see if there is any in the
tank."</p>

<p>"Not a drop," exclaimed the other in a terrified
voice; "this rotten tank has sprung
another leak."</p>

<p>"Get out an oar and make for that sloop,"
cried the red-bearded man.</p>

<p>Fifty feet away was a sloop yacht anchored;
her sail was all spread, though the sheets were
not belayed. A fresh breeze was blowing down
the Severn; this helped the gasoline boat, and
with the aid of the oars it was soon alongside
the sloop. "Jump aboard, quick with you,"
cried the leader; "come along, Georgie; run
forward, Jim, and heave up the anchor; never
mind our boat&mdash;we've no time to lose&mdash;I'll
look out for the sheets and helm."</p>

<p>With a practiced hand the man with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
red beard grabbed the tiller. They found
nobody aboard&mdash;but the sails being loosed and
no small boat being alongside it was likely
that a party to go sailing would soon be pulled
off from the shore to the yacht.</p>

<p>The anchor was hove up to the bows in a
moment, the head of the yacht swung round,
the sails filled, and she was off with a bound.</p>

<p>With a critical eye the man at the helm
trimmed the different sails, set the trysail and
then heaved a sigh of profound relief.</p>

<p>"I think we're safe," he said; "hello, there's
a navy ship on the port bow, and another one
several miles away on the starboard bow. I'll
steer between&mdash;they don't know anything
about us&mdash;they won't bother us."</p>

<p>While the superintendent of the Naval
Academy was sitting at his desk this same
afternoon, his telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>"Hello, what is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Is this the superintendent?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This is Halstead, aboard the 'Santee.'"</p>

<p>"What is it, Halstead?"</p>

<p>"Sir, the quartermaster has reported that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
gasoline launch went alongside the 'Robert
Centre' a few minutes ago and several people
got out of the launch and went aboard the
yacht; the gasoline launch is now drifting
down the river and the 'Robert Centre' is
tearing out into the bay."</p>

<p>"Who were the people that got out of the
launch?"</p>

<p>"The quartermaster says they were strangers.
One was a man with a red beard, and a
little boy was along."</p>

<p>"Had anybody intended to take the 'Robert
Centre' out to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Brooks and some friends of
his. They are now being pulled out in the
river in the 'Centre's' boat. What shall I do,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Hoist the 'Robert Centre's' recall. Secure
the gasoline launch and keep it awaiting my
orders. Have the quartermaster keep a good
lookout on the 'Robert Centre' to see where
she goes. Have you any steamer you could
send for her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, the 'Standish' is out with the
'Nevada.'"</p>

<p>"I think you'll find that the matter will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
explained; it was probably a party of young
officers out for a lark and a sail. Or it may
have been some friends of officers; it will no
doubt come out all right."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the superintendent was
again called up by the telephone.</p>

<p>"This is the superintendent. What is it?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I am Detective Cross, a Pinkerton detective.
I traced the kidnappers of the Thompson
boy to No Man's Creek, near the Severn,
below Indian Landing. They saw me and
shoved their boat off in a hurry, and went
down river. The boy is with them. I've had
a time finding a telephone in this forsaken
country; keep a lookout for a green gasoline
launch; it has a cabin in it&mdash;three kidnappers
and Georgie Thompson were in the&mdash;&mdash;"
But the superintendent had heard enough and,
ringing off the speaker, he commenced to do
some rapid telephoning on his own account.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="center">SIX-POUNDER TARGET PRACTICE</p>


<p>Graduation day drew near, bringing exultant
happiness to Robert Drake. Not many
more things could occur to him&mdash;the annual
examinations were soon to be held, but these
brought no terrors to Robert's mind. Most of
the drills had been finished, and the first and
second companies were now neck and neck in
competition for the first place, with Blair's
company slightly in the lead. The final
standing now depended upon the records these
respective companies made at target practice.</p>

<p>Annapolis was now in ribboned and brass-buttoned
glory. Proudly the brigade of midshipmen
marched each afternoon for dress
parade, and on the walks viewing them was
much fluttering loveliness. Then, after dismissal,
came pleasant, even if short, strolls
through the grounds, in and about the shady
walks.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert was happy because of four years of
hard work well done and well appreciated.
He loved the place. Every tree on the
grounds was an old friend, and every spot near
and about old Annapolis called up pleasant
memories.</p>

<p>The important things yet to occur were
target practice, the first class german, graduation,
and the great June ball.</p>

<p>Among the midshipmen there were a few,
however, who were not happy at this time.
Among them was Harry Blunt; in danger of
failing in mathematics, disturbed by reproachful
looks from his mother and sister
and worried by severe letters from his father,
he commenced to have an anxious appearance,
and actually abandoned the gaieties that were
now thrust into midshipman life in favor of
much neglected books; the dreaded annual
examinations were almost upon him.</p>

<p>Midshipman Bligh, though also in the same
precarious position, seemed to lose some of
the gloom he had been carrying about him
and become more normal. He went into the
city of Annapolis at every opportunity and
always came back with a grateful heart; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Bligh had found a friend who believed in him,
and this friend had rescued Bligh from the pit
of despondency and terrible sadness into which
he had descended.</p>

<p>"Say, Bob," remarked Stonewell one day,
"have you noticed that fellow Bligh of late?"</p>

<p>"I never happen to think of him. What
about him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much, except that I am constantly
meeting him. He never seems to look
at me, but whenever I go out in town nowadays
he's pretty sure to be standing at the
Maryland Avenue gate; and then later, half
the time I go out I meet him somewhere.
This has happened so often of late that I
can't help but feel he's interested in where I
go."</p>

<p>"Lots of people are interested in where you
go, Stone; every day somebody asks me why
you go out so much alone. For years we have
gone out together, but now you never want
me."</p>

<p>"It's not that," replied Stonewell hurriedly,&mdash;"I've
had some personal matters come up
that require my attention. Look here, that
Bligh is going to bilge, isn't he?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is practically certain to. He is low in
every study&mdash;he'll have to make bigger marks
in each of them than he ever yet has made to
get satisfactory in the final average. But he
may do it; people have pulled out of worse
holes than he is in."</p>

<p>"What are you reading, Bob? You seem
to be giving that newspaper a good deal of
your attention to-day."</p>

<p>"I'm reading about the boy who was kidnapped
in Baltimore several days ago. First
it was thought the boy was lost, but now the
police believe he was kidnapped; it says here
that Mr. Thompson has received word his boy
will be restored to him on payment of ten
thousand dollars. By George! I hope they
catch the kidnappers and send them to prison
for life. That's an awful crime!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed; and just think, Baltimore is
only thirty miles away. I've been reading
about that Thompson boy and I do hope he
will be sent back home. Well, Bob, are you
all ready for your target practice? Do you
really put faith in this new sight you have
invented?"</p>

<p>"More so every day, Stone, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
since I've learned that practically the same
sight as I have aboard the 'Nevada' has been
put on many different guns throughout the
navy. Anybody who sees it and works with
it a little is bound to believe it is far better
than the old sights. Those were simply
miserable. I'm now fifteen or twenty points
behind Blair, with only target practice yet to
be heard from, and I'm sure to beat him. I'd
beat him even if we should use the old sights.
You see I have a really very well-drilled crew;
they load rapidly. I'm wild to get into the
practice; I've a flag at stake, you know. It
will be settled before night. Hello, the bugle
has busted. Let's get to formation."</p>

<p>On board the monitor "Nevada" they
joined the other midshipmen, and soon she was
under way and steaming through the buoyed
channel to the free waters of Chesapeake Bay.
The "Nevada" had on board the officers belonging
to the Department of Ordnance and
Gunnery and a number of midshipmen; there
were also on board a six-pounder crew of five
men from each of the twelve companies of
midshipmen. In addition many midshipmen
who had no duties but who were interested in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
seeing the target practice were allowed to be
present. Soon a cry from aloft was heard.</p>

<p>"Sail ho!" cried the midshipman lookout
on the "Nevada's" mast.</p>

<p>"Where away, can you make her out?" returned
the midshipman officer-of-the-deck,
hailing the lookout.</p>

<p>"Right ahead, sir, but I don't know what
it is. It looks like a funny kind of a ship
with six sails on it."</p>

<p>"Who made that ridiculous report?" inquired
Commander Brice in great disgust. "If
it were an ordinary seaman I'd disrate him
to an afterguard sweeper. But I imagine it's
a future admiral. The sail he's reported are
the targets&mdash;there are six of them. Anybody
but a midshipman would know it. They've
been in sight ever since we left the Severn
River."</p>

<p>The target was now seen by everybody and
the "Nevada" steered for it. It was at the
apex of an equilateral triangle each side of
which was one thousand yards long. The
word targets, rather than target, should have
been used, because in this apex, for the purpose
of expediting this practice, of finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
it in one afternoon, six targets on rafts had
been placed. The tug "Standish" was anchored
near by. She had brought a party of enlisted
men, who had been working all morning,
and had erected the marks.</p>

<p>Commander Shaw, the head of the Department
of Ordnance and Gunnery, remained on
the bridge with Commander Brice until the
"Nevada" had cleared the channel. Then,
as he descended the ladder leading from the
bridge to the superstructure deck, he was met
by an eager-faced midshipman, who cried to
him:</p>

<p>"Captain Shaw, do you remember we were
all encouraged by your instructors to make
any improvements we could in the guns we
were to drill with?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed, Mr. Drake," replied Commander
Shaw, smiling with interest at
Robert's eagerness. "What have you been
doing?"</p>

<p>"I will show you, sir. Will you please
come over to the starboard six-pounder
gun?"</p>

<p>Robert stepped quickly to the starboard
side, followed by the commander. He then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
quickly unscrewed the regular gun sights,
drew them out of the sockets, and threw
them over to Chief Gunner's Mate Lenn. The
latter handed Robert a long parcel wrapped
in paper.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bob, what have you there, a new
gun?" laughed Blair. "Say, fellows, let's
see what Bob is up to." Everybody became
interested and crowded about, and many were
the laughing remarks made to Robert. But
the latter, paying no attention to these,
quickly stripped the paper from the parcel,
and a long brass pipe was exposed to the
curious eyes about him. On one end of the
pipe was clamped a piece of metal which carried
a circular ring, across which were attached,
at right angles, thin silvery-white
wires. At the other end of the pipe was attached
a small brass cylinder, closed except
for a minute hole through its centre. Near
the cross wire end, hanging from the pipe,
was a solid plug, cylindrical in section.</p>

<p>Robert worked rapidly. He slipped this
plug into the recess left by the front sight,
putting in several thin washers; at the rear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>end of the brass pipe was attached a condemned
rear sight, one furnished by Lenn,
and this naturally slipped into its place.</p>

<p>"By George, Mr. Drake," cried out Commander
Shaw, "this is splendid. It's the
Paul Jones' bar sight! She won this year's
six-pounder record by that sight&mdash;I only
yesterday received a drawing of it&mdash;how in
the world did you get this up?"</p>

<p>"Several helped, sir, and Chief Gunner's
Mate Lenn did all the work about it. May I
use these sights, sir, on my target practice to-day?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you may, and all of the rest of the
gun crews will. We've known for some time
the old sights were very poor. I'm delighted,
Mr. Drake."</p>

<p>Robert's face was radiant with happiness.
His classmates crowded about him; everybody
saw at a glance that Robert's sight was
a decided improvement.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Bob," said Blair to
him. "I guess you've got the flag and you
deserve to have it; this is just fine. Captain
Shaw," continued Blair, "I request permission
to fire my shots with the old sights."</p>

<p>"Not granted, sir."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, captain, there is a special reason
why I should, a big reason. You see, sir,
Drake and I are fighting for the flag; this
target practice will decide things; one of us
is bound to win it; now he has got up this
sight and it would certainly be unfair to him
if I were to get the benefit of his good ideas
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain Shaw," cried Robert, interrupting
Blair, "if you think it's a good sight let's all
fire with it, and give the Naval Academy a
better record in target practice than last year;
and if Blair can beat me out&mdash;then all the
more credit to him, for I've had a lot of practice
in aiming and loading. And, captain, I'd
like to have each crew practice as much as
they can find time for; I've had hours of it.
It's very easy to go from the old sights to this;
you just keep the gun pointed with your
shoulder and arm so that the line through the
peep-hole and intersection of cross wires prolonged
will meet the object you want to hit.
Here, Sam, you take the gun and get used to
it."</p>

<p>"Bob, this is awfully white of you, and it's
not fair to you."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you'll all fire with this new
sight of Mr. Drake's," announced Commander
Shaw, decisively.</p>

<p>"Bob, I'm going to do my best, of course,
but you ought to win; if I should happen to
get credited for the most hits I couldn't feel I
deserved to beat you."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Sam," chuckled Robert;
"I've been practicing with that sight for some
months. If you can win you've a right to."</p>

<p>Robert was radiantly happy; this public
recognition of his having done something
worth while filled him with joy. And at the
same time he was completely confident that
he would make the best record during the
day. He was really desirous of having everybody
who fired use the sight he had installed,
because he expected to win anyway. He knew
in his heart that with all the special drill he
had had he was practically certain to make
the highest score in target practice, no matter
which sight was used, and he felt he would
really have more credit if all who fired used
the same sights.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, each pointer will have a
chance to practice with Mr. Drake's bar sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
before he fires," announced Commander Shaw.
"Mr. Drake, you will fire first. Are you
bore sighted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, everything is ready, but I'd like
to fire a trial shot."</p>

<p>"Very well. We'll steam to the range and
give you a trial shot, and then Mr. Blair may
practice aiming. Then we'll go on the range
and you will commence, and when you finish
the second company's gun crew will commence;
as soon as they finish, and while
turning the ship around for the return run,
the pointers of the third and fourth crews will
practice with the sight. We'll fire two pointers
on a run and practice two on the return, so
after six double runs we will have fired at the
six targets; then a boat from the 'Standish'
will patch up the targets, and after that we'll
fire the other six gun crews; we ought to
finish before five o'clock. Have you your
range cards ready, and a stop-watch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right." Then to Commander Brice on
the bridge: "Are you making ten knots, captain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, just exactly ten knots."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take your trial shot just after we pass the
first buoy, Mr Drake."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'm ready, sir."</p>

<p>The "Nevada" was now rapidly approaching
the range, which was marked by three
buoys in line, this line forming the base of the
triangle, of which the targets were in the apex.
The "Nevada" was to travel just outside of
the line while the six-pounder was being fired.</p>

<p>"What yacht is that?" asked Commander
Shaw of Commander Brice, indicating a yacht
that had evidently just come from Annapolis.</p>

<p>"That's the 'Robert Centre,'"replied Commander
Brice, after looking at her through his
glasses.</p>

<p>"I think she has come out to see the target
practice, and I'll wager a ship's biscuit that a
party of midshipmen with some girl friends
are on board," he continued, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Just look at the way sail is crowded on
her. Jerusalem! the fellow who is running
that yacht has a lot of nerve; he's got every
rag stretched that's aboard."</p>

<p>The "Robert Centre" was a yacht that some
years previous had been presented to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>Naval Academy, and in leisure hours midshipmen
were allowed to sail her in Chesapeake
Bay. She was coming out under a
great press of canvas with a fresh, spanking
breeze on her port quarter.</p>

<p>"I'll blow the ship's steam whistle when
the first buoy is abeam of the mast," called
out Commander Shaw. "Mr. Drake, take
your trial shot as soon after as you please."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>In a moment there was a strident blast from
the steam whistle and immediately after:
"Bang!" went the six-pounder.</p>

<p>Many midshipmen, not prepared for the
deafening report, jumped violently.</p>

<p>"A bull's-eye," cried out Commander Shaw
in delight. "Mr. Drake, your sight is all
right, and the powder is all right. Captain
Brice, I'd like to go back and commence over
again. Mr. Drake, let Mr. Blair practice
sighting the gun. You'll find, Mr. Blair, that
the new sights are easier to shoot with. Mr.
Drake, I'm delighted; that was a bully good
shot."</p>

<p>Again the "Nevada" steamed toward the
range.</p>

<p>"Now, fellows," said Robert, "put cotton in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
your ears and don't mind about the noise;
get the gun loaded as soon as I fire; and,
Glass, be sure you throw the shell in home;
the only chance of a poor score is a jammed
cartridge."</p>

<p>The "Nevada" rapidly approached the first
buoy. An intense, breathless silence, an air
of solemnity, pervaded the ship. Standing
like statues grouped about the six-pounder
gun that was about to fire, were Robert and
his crew, with grim determination written on
every face.</p>

<p>"After the whistle blows commence firing
immediately," ordered Commander Shaw.
"I'll time you with a stop-watch; you will
fire for just a minute; jump back the instant I
tap you on the arm like this. Mr. Blair,
have your crew ready to jump to the gun just
when I signal to Mr. Drake to cease."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," came the replies in unison
from both Robert and Blair.</p>

<p>When the whistle blew, there came a novel
sensation to those on board who had never before
seen a navy target practice.</p>

<p>A sheet of white flame burst from the
muzzle of the six-pounder, a thunderous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
reverberating report assaulted the ears of
everybody, and hardly had this been experienced
when the same thing was repeated, over
and over again. The grim statues at the gun
had burst into reckless life. At the first shot,
the recoil of the gun had thrown down the
breech-block and so had opened the gun,
ejecting the used cartridge case. The gun was
ready for loading, and Glassfell lost no time.
Hardly had the empty cartridge case been
ejected than into the chamber he threw a
fresh shell. A spring was automatically released,
throwing the breech-block into place,
and the gun was ready for firing. Almost instantly
it was discharged, for Robert never allowed
the sights to leave the target.</p>

<p>And so a thunderous bang! bang! bang!
was kept up from the gun.</p>

<p>Commander Brice, on top of the pilot
house, with his glasses leveled on the target,
was in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p>"A bull's-eye," he cried, "another bull's-eye,
a beautiful shot, wonderful shooting."</p>

<p>While this was going on, a wild-eyed enlisted
man, scantily clad in working trousers
and undershirt, and evidently under intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
excitement, came tumbling up on the superstructure
deck, screaming, "Captain, captain."</p>

<p>He ran into half a dozen midshipmen, fell
down twice, reached the ladder leading to the
pilot house top, still continuing his wild cry of
"Captain." He bumped into Captain Brice,
and when the latter turned angrily around to
him, he thrust a paper into the captain's
hands.</p>

<p>Commander Brice read the paper, and then
in a stentorian voice cried out: "Cease
firing."</p>

<p>At the same instant Commander Shaw
touched Robert on the shoulder and called
"time."</p>

<p>"Cease firing," repeated Commander Brice.
"Keep Mr. Drake and his crew at the gun!
Hard a starboard the helm! Call away the
life-boat. Gunner's mate, get up twelve rifles
and rifle ammunition, double time! Captain
Shaw, detail Lieutenant Joynes to take charge
of the life-boat; have two midshipmen crews,
armed with rifles, prepared to go in the life-boat
when it is lowered. Ease the helm,
amidships with it&mdash;steady so."</p>

<p>Many pairs of surprised eyes were upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Commander Brice. With glasses up to his
eyes, he was now looking at a yacht on the
starboard bow, recognized by everybody to be
the "Robert Centre" which, some distance
away, was careening far to one side and was
bowling along at a furious speed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake!" called out Commander
Brice.</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Do you see the 'Robert Centre'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Drop a shell under her bows. Don't hit
her. The range is about fifteen hundred
yards."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="center">A GOOD SHOT WITH THE SIX-POUNDER</p>


<p>"Bang," went the six-pounder, and four
seconds later a heavy column of water rose
up under the bow of the "Robert Centre,"
three quarters of a mile away.</p>

<p>"Well placed," called out Commander
Brice, as he saw the shot fall. "What," he
exclaimed a moment later, "the rascal won't
heave to! Split the mast, Mr. Drake, six feet
above the deck."</p>

<p>Hardly had he given the order when Robert
again fired.</p>

<p>"Five feet to the right; aim a little to the
left of the mast."</p>

<p>Again a sheet of flame leaped from the six-pounder's
mouth, again the thunderous reverberating
report, dying out in far-away echoes,
rolled from the gun.</p>

<p>Except for Commander Brice's orders, the
noise of the gun, and the now painfully loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
throbbing of the engines, an intense stillness prevailed
on the "Nevada's" deck. Thoroughly
accustomed to navy ways, not a soul on board
thought of questioning the captain's reason
for injuring the graceful yacht, which had seen
many pleasant sailing parties of midshipmen
and their friends. All eyes were on the
yacht; a few seconds after Robert's last shot
the tall raking mast was seen suddenly to
snap off close to the deck. Down went the
mast over the side into the water, carrying
with it every sail; and the yacht a minute
before so full of life and spirit, so swiftly
plunging through the water, now rolled helplessly,
inert and lifeless.</p>

<p>"A beautiful shot, Mr. Drake," cried Commander
Brice, delightedly. "Mr. Joynes, as
soon as we are near that yacht I'll slow down
and stop and you lower the life-boat; get your
armed crew aboard, and row over to the 'Robert
Centre'! Take three men and a small boy from
her&mdash;and let go the yacht's anchor; we'll let
the 'Standish' tow her in after target practice."</p>

<p>"What is it, Brice?" asked Commander
Shaw, who had gone up on top of the pilot
house.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Read this wireless message from the
superintendent. It's evident that the kidnappers
of Georgie Thompson stole the
'Robert Centre' and now are on board with
the boy. By Jingo! Mr. Drake did some
fine shooting. Between wireless telegraphy
and good shooting villainy isn't profitable
these days."</p>

<p>Before long three silent, gloomy men and a
small boy were brought on board. Two of
the men were on the verge of collapse; new
life had come to little Georgie, who wondered
what it was all about.</p>

<p>"Master-at-arms, put these men in a cell
and place a guard over them. Where is the
wireless operator? Oh&mdash;send this message immediately.
Look here, my little man, is your
name Georgie Thompson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Where is my papa? Is he here?
What were those awful noises, Mister? May
I have a piece of bread and butter? I'm
awfully hungry. Where is my papa?"</p>

<p>"Steward, take Georgie to my cabin and
keep him there, and get him something to
eat, right away. Full speed, both engines,
hard aport the helm. Now we'll run back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
by the buoys again. Take charge, Shaw, and
fire as you will."</p>

<p>Before long Blair's crew fired at its target,
and in quick succession the remaining four
targets were fired at, and then the "Nevada"
ran up to the targets to count the shot holes
in them and the "Standish" went up to repair
them.</p>

<p>Never did Robert Drake have a more
exultant feeling than when he saw the holes
his shots had torn through the canvas. He
had fired twenty-two times in his minute, and
there were nineteen gaping holes in his target.
Blair had fired sixteen times and had made
thirteen hits. Robert now knew the flag was
his and he was glad indeed. Six more crews
were to fire, but he knew in his heart that
none could hope to equal his record, because
none had had the practice his crew had had.</p>

<p>Nothing could have exceeded the cordial
congratulations of his closest rival, Blair.</p>

<p>"You've beaten me out, Bob, but, by George,
you deserve to. I'm not ashamed of my
score; thirteen hits is not a bad record&mdash;but
what luck you have had&mdash;what a wonderful
bull's-eye you made when you knocked down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the 'Robert Centre's' mast; you deserve the
flag, Bob! There's no doubt of that fact;
you've won it, and by no fluke."</p>

<p>The targets were soon patched up, and the
remaining six gun crews fired their shots.
On the whole the target practice was very
good and the midshipmen and the ordnance
officers present were jubilant.</p>

<p>The "Nevada" returned to her wharf at
six o'clock, and found a great crowd waiting
for her. Present was a middle-aged gentleman,
Mr. Thompson, who had come down
from Baltimore on a special train; he was
full of emotion and feeling, and wild with
eagerness to see once more the dear little boy
who had been so rudely torn from him.</p>

<p>Among the crowd were police officers,
sailormen, and a company of marines. The
transfer of the three miscreants to the police
did not take long. Outside of the Naval
Academy gate a howling, derisive mob of
whites and blacks had gathered and they
jeered the miserable criminals as they were
taken through the streets to the railroad
station.</p>

<p>Language was not powerful enough for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Thompson to express his gratitude. "What
can I do for you, sir?" he asked of Commander
Brice. "I had determined to give the
kidnappers the ten thousand dollars they demanded;
could I&mdash;may I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your train doesn't leave for a couple of
hours, Mr. Thompson; suppose you take
dinner with me&mdash;and of course you know
how glad we all are your boy is restored to
you. But I'm going to introduce to you the
midshipman who knocked the mast out of
the yacht, the bulliest shot I've ever seen.
Come here, Mr. Drake; this is Georgie's
father."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, Mr. Drake?"
eagerly asked the happy man. "Please say
something&mdash;do let me do something for you."</p>

<p>Robert thought a moment, and then said:
"Why, sir, I'm going to graduate in less than
three weeks; won't you come to my graduation,
sir? I'd be so glad if you would."</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson looked reproachfully at them
both. "Well, all I can say is, you are all
gentlemen, every one of you!" Tears stood
in his eyes as he said this, and he couldn't
have said anything that would have touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and pleased officers and midshipmen more
deeply.</p>

<p>This affair redounded to the credit of the
Naval Academy. The superintendent had
acted quickly, Captain Brice had acted with
judgment, and midshipmen could hit when
they shot. This was the boiled-down newspaper
comment.</p>

<p>"How did you feel, Bob, when you shot at
the 'Robert Centre's' mast?" asked Stonewell
later.</p>

<p>"Feel? Why, I didn't feel at all, beyond an
intention to hit the mast."</p>

<p>"But wasn't there an idea in your mind
that you might hurt somebody?"</p>

<p>"You see, Stone," said Robert, "at that
moment Captain Brice's will dominated my
action; I was a machine, an automaton. I
was completely controlled by him. Now
when we talk this over in cold blood it seems
terrible, but I suppose that in a case like that
a man loses all personal feeling&mdash;he is under
a peculiar power. I imagine this is human
nature and accounts for a lot of things. In
our case it results no doubt from the military
training we have received here these last four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
years. Now when we get an order from the
commandant or officer-in-charge we just
naturally obey it."</p>

<p>"I think you're right, Bob. Well, old
chap, you are graduating with flying colors.
I'd rather have aimed the shot that took
down the 'Robert Centre's' mast than have
done any other thing that has happened
since I became a midshipman. You've won
the flag, that was your great ambition; and
you are graduating number five or six. But
everybody here isn't as happy as you and I
are, Bob. I'm quite concerned over Harry
Blunt; he stands in some danger of bilging;
not a great deal, but it is possible."</p>

<p>Robert stiffened immediately. "Since
when have you taken up with that rascal,
Stone?"</p>

<p>"Look here, you've no right to call him a
rascal. You've Frenched yourself; so have I,
so have Blair and Farnum."</p>

<p>"Since when have you taken up with him,
Stone?" persisted Robert.</p>

<p>"I haven't taken up with him; I hardly
ever have occasion to speak with him. But I
think a lot of Helen and his father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
mother. You do too; you don't want to see
him bilge, do you?"</p>

<p>"For the sake of his father and mother and
sister, no. Let's talk of something else.
This is Friday; the annual examinations
commence on Monday. They will soon be
over and we graduate in two weeks. I'll hate
to leave this place, Stone; I've had such a
happy year."</p>

<p>"It has been fine, indeed. Well, Bob, we'll
be back here as instructors some day. Perhaps
one of us may be officer-in-charge. By
the way, I'm going to say good-bye to you for
a couple of days. I've leave to go to Washington.
I'm going to take the five o'clock
train to-night and I'll be back Sunday morning
at about ten o'clock."</p>

<p>Robert looked at his roommate with unconcealed
amazement.</p>

<p>"Well, Stone, you'll excuse my being
astonished. But for an intimate chum you
are the most remarkably secretive, non-communicative,
open-hearted fellow that ever
lived. Why, to go to Washington is an event
for a midshipman. Were I going to Washington,
everybody in my class would know of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
it. But it's just in line with your lonely trips
out to Conduit Street. Now, Stone, I'm intensely
interested, you know that; and I'm
not going to ask any questions; but if you can
tell me why you are going, what you are
going to do, I do wish you would."</p>

<p>"Bob, I've had a family matter on my mind
for some time and I just cannot talk about it.
But I think everything is coming out all
right. I expect to be back here with a free
mind Sunday morning and I hope to talk
openly with you then. Good-bye; I'm going
to start now."</p>

<p>"I'll go to the train with you; there's plenty
of time."</p>

<p>"Bob," said Stonewell, awkwardly, "I've
got an errand to do before I go, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, Stone, I understand. Good-bye,
old chap, and good luck. Conduit Street
again," muttered Robert to himself, after
Stonewell had left.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="center">GRICE APPEARS AGAIN</p>


<p>Robert Drake's character was singularly
generous and ingenuous. He had taken the
greatest of interest in his various studies and
drills. At no time did he ever have desire or
ambition of standing first in his class. Without
being brilliant he had a good, clear mind
with excellent reasoning ability, and by hard
work and diligent application he had finally
taken high class rank, and now he was certain
to be graduated. So much had come to him
this last year in the way of friendship and
honors that it had proved one of heartfelt
satisfaction to him, and Robert realized that he
would always look back upon this year as
probably the happiest period of his life.</p>

<p>Stonewell had left on Friday, and the next
night Robert went to a hop given at the
Armory. These occur many times during the
year, and serve to bring desired relaxation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
pleasure into the crowded, hard-working life
of the midshipman.</p>

<p>"Helen, is your gown all ready?" asked
Robert with glad triumph in his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Robert," exclaimed Helen with enthusiasm,
"I knew you would win the flag.
I'm so happy about it, and so is father and
mother. You see we are really proud of our
friend who has done so well. Really, Robert,
I am truly glad to be distinguished among
your friends by your asking me to present the
flag. I wanted you to win it for yourself, not
for the brief distinction that comes to me; and
actually I don't present it to you; it's already
yours. I've had these thoughts all day,
Robert; I can only say I'm proud to be the
one to present the flag to you, just because I'm
proud of my friend."</p>

<p>"Don't analyze too much, Helen; take the
day as it comes and enjoy the honey of the
hour. You see, the friendship of you and your
father and mother is something I will always
remember, and little as the flag presentation
may be, neither you nor yours will forget it."</p>

<p>"Little!" exclaimed Helen, the real girl
coming out, her philosophizing over; "well!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
I guess it won't be little. I'm to be out in
front of seven hundred midshipmen, all by
myself, and there will be ten thousand other
people looking at me. I will have on a new
gown made at the Convent at Baltimore and
a new hat and a gorgeous bouquet of American
beauties. I imagine you won't think it's little
when it happens, Robert Drake."</p>

<p>Robert laughed. "That's right, Helen;
that's the way to feel. By the way, do you
remember that Sunday long ago, when we
took our first walk? It was soon after I first
met you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. And you helped me jump over
a mud-puddle."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the invitation I gave
you then to our class graduation german and
ball?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Robert, I remember all that and you
have spoken of it since. Indeed I shall be
glad to go with you."</p>

<p>"I was just thinking how pleasant our
friendship has been, Helen, and how all of
these things have come to pass. I was so blue
and unhappy the day I first went to your
father's house&mdash;you see there weren't many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
people who had a friendly word for me then.
Your father has always been a true friend of
mine."</p>

<p>"Indeed he is. He is here to-night; hunt
him up later; he always speaks of you when
he comes to Annapolis; he will talk to you of
your father; he sees him every day now. But,
Robert, I can't help but be surprised that
though you are so friendly to father and
mother and me, you are always so hostile to
Harry. Harry wants to be friendly; he said
only yesterday that he liked you, but that
you cut him every time you met him."</p>

<p>"I wish your brother every good luck,
Helen, and I hope he'll be worthy of his
father. Some time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Robert, there's that old colored man in
the doorway again, old Grice&mdash;he is surely
beckoning to you&mdash;I wonder if he has 'disregarded'
with his wife again about religion.
Go and see what he wants and come back and
tell me about it."</p>

<p>It was now nearing eleven o'clock. In
their talk Robert and Helen had walked
several times around the room, so engrossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>with each other that they paid but little attention
to the beautiful music and none to
the happy throng of young people gliding
over the floor. Robert looked with annoyance
at Grice. The latter was now gesticulating
frantically at him through the open doorway.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Grice?" he asked almost
roughly.</p>

<p>"Come 'long, Mistah Drake," the old
colored man cried; "come 'long or yo'll be too
late."</p>

<p>"Come along where?"</p>

<p>"To the department of mathmax. The
two midshipmen gwine ter steal the zamnation
at 'leven 'clock ter-night."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"They come las' night. I was there. I
heared dem talk; they had keys an' opened
the doors and desk where the zamnations are
kept. I heared one say the zamnations were
not there; he says, 'We'll come back 'leven
Saturday night; the zamnations are sure to be
here Saturday night.' And they wuz right.
I knowed the zamnation wusn't there den, but
dey is there now. So, come 'long, hurry up."</p>

<p>"Have you told anybody?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, suh," and a look of cunning came
over the face of the old darkey. "'Deed I
haven't, Mistah Drake. Ef I tole anybody he
would say ole Grice lied and I would be dismissed.
No, suh, I haven't tole no one.
Come 'long, Mistah Drake, or the zamnation
will be stole."</p>

<p>"You idiot," exclaimed Robert, intensely
angry. He looked about hoping to see some
officer he could consult, but none were near
him; he had a notion of getting some midshipman
to go with him, but at this instant
"Home Sweet Home" was started by the
band, indicating the close of the dance, and
now it would be impossible to get any advice
or anybody to come with him. "Fletcher,"
he said to the midshipmen's head waiter, who
was at the lemonade stand, "find Captain
Blunt; tell him I'm unexpectedly called
away; ask him to tell his daughter."</p>

<p>"Come 'long, Mistah Drake, or the zamnation
will be stole, an' ef it is I'll tell the commandant
ter-morrer that I tole yo' an' yo'
wouldn't come. Come 'long, suh," urged the
old man, his face glowing with an eager,
frightened look.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert groaned in extreme disgust. The
matter was unutterably distasteful to him,
but he felt helpless. He wished that the examination
had been stolen and he had known
nothing about it. But there was no help for
him; he knew he had to go, so with an impatient
angry exclamation he quickly went to
the hat room on his right, and a moment
later joined Grice. Without further talk the
two then ran across the grounds and soon
were in the Academic building. Here all
was dark, but Grice had keys with him and
led the way.</p>

<p>"They'll be heah soon, suh," whispered
Grice; "now ef you go behind that table, an'
kneel down, you'll be near the zamnation
papers; I'll go over heah, an' after they get to
the desk I'll turn on the 'lectric light."</p>

<p>Robert took the old man's suggestion and
crouched down by a long table. The moonlight
streaming through the window threw
weird, ghostlike shadows over the floor and
gave Robert a creepy sensation. He felt intensely
annoyed and irritated to be there, but
realized it was a duty he could not avoid.
At the other end of the room was old Grice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
outside was heard the rumble of carriages coming
from the Armory; the bell in the yard
struck six, and was followed like an echo by
the bells from the ships and tugs at anchor in
the harbor. A marine sentinel not far away
called out in tones long drawn out the words,
"Post number three&mdash;and all's well."</p>

<p>And then came a slight noise. Some one
was surely fumbling at the door. In the stillness
Robert could hear his heart beat. It
seemed as though seconds were prolonged into
hours. Soon Robert was conscious that the
door leading out into the hall was being slowly
opened and softly closed. And then in the
dim moonlight, he saw two dark figures like
phantoms, making no sound, approach the desk
where he knew the examination questions of
the coming week were kept. With painful
intensity of mind, and with a suffocating feeling,
he saw them pause before the desk and
heard a faint jingle, as of keys on a ring.</p>

<p>Then the room was suddenly flooded with
light.</p>

<p>Robert never afterward liked to think, far
less to speak, of the feelings he experienced in
the next few seconds. They brought him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>more agony, more desolate grief, than he had
ever felt before, or, it is hoped, will ever come
again to him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="images/i004.png" width="467" height="700" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>HE SAW TWO DARK FIGURES</i></span></span>
</div>

<p>With startled, frightened glances the two
jumped up. One was in civilian garb, a brown
slouch hat was down over his forehead, a heavy
dark moustache and beard covered his face;
he wore a tightly buttoned up coat. The
other was in midshipman uniform, and five
golden stripes adorned each sleeve.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Robert, in anguish; "oh,
Stonewell." Robert himself, unseen under the
table, was almost overcome with grief and dismay.
The bearded man jumped as if he
had been shot, and then his companion exclaimed
in a low voice: "Run, Harry, we're
caught."</p>

<p>As he said this both bolted from the room,
and the last Robert saw of them was the electric
light flashing on the golden stripes, which
for a year had been Robert's joy, and the pride
of every midshipman, but were now so dishonored
and disgraced.</p>

<p>The shock was too unexpected, too sudden
for Robert. So his beloved friend, his idol of
manhood and honor, the ideal all-around mid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>shipman
of his time, had proved to be but a
low, contemptible dastard&mdash;</p>

<p>Robert's head sank on his knees and unrestrained
convulsive sobs burst from his lips.
He was suddenly robbed of that which was
dearest to him; and blank hopeless desolation
took possession of him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="center">ROBERT RESIGNS</p>


<p>"Didn't I tole yo' so, suh? That other man
was Mistah Harry Blunt, suh; didn't yo' hear
Mistah Stonewell call him Harry, suh? An'
suppose dis ole niggah had done tole the commandan'
that Mistah Stonewell, the fines'
gemman in the 'Cademy, and Mistah Harry
Blunt, the son of Capt'in Blunt, were stealin'
zamnations, what would have happened ter
ole Grice? He'd been 'cused of lyin', yo'
knows dat, Mistah Drake. I known fer seberal
months dat Mistah Harry Blunt been goin'
about town in cibilians' close, but I ben
feared to tole any one. Ain't I right, Mistah
Drake? We done catched 'em, suh, an' yo' is
evidence that ole Grice done tole de truf."</p>

<p>With horror in his heart, and almost unmanned
by the situation which had so suddenly
burst upon him, Robert was speechless.
He was confused, entirely confounded. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
one of these unprincipled midshipmen was
Harry Blunt did not surprise Robert; he was
quite ready to believe anything of that young
man. But it brought him into an intensely
disagreeable position. He knew he would be
called upon for evidence, and to give testimony
that would cover all of the Blunt family with
ignominious disgrace&mdash;that family who had
rescued his own father and mother from absolute
want, which had put his father in a self-respecting,
self-supporting position. "I had
rather bilge than do it," thought our cadet
lieutenant. Wild bitterness toward Harry
Blunt filled his mind. And yet these feelings
sank to small dimensions compared to those
concerning Stonewell. Faith in everything
seemed to be lost with faith and trust lost in
this old friend. And combined with this was
a feeling of inexpressible amazement, amazement
made up of many different things.</p>

<p>Robert was astonished that any reason could
have existed which would have induced Stonewell
to join Harry Blunt in such an enterprise.
In a helpless, uncertain way, Robert imagined
that Blunt had some hold over Stonewell, and
even this was hard to believe. "But how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
else can I account for it?" he asked himself.
"I never would have believed anybody, or
any number of people had they told me they
had seen Stone do this&mdash;but it was Stone&mdash;in
his uniform with his five stripes on his
sleeve."</p>

<p>Had Robert known of a conversation between
the two intruders after they had dashed
out of the building, he would have been still
more amazed. "It's too bad, Stonewell," said
the one; "you did it all for me&mdash;no man ever
did so much for me as you have. But I'm
afraid you were recognized; I wish you hadn't
had on that uniform and had some disguise.
I'm awfully sorry I got you into this."</p>

<p>"Don't feel that way, Harry; I suggested
it," replied the other. "I hope I was not
recognized. But if I were, I will have to
stand for it. Did you see anybody in the
room?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Harry; "my one hope is
that whoever it was didn't see you; nobody
would have known me. Good-night; I'll be
around to Conduit Street to-morrow afternoon
and will tell you of any talk I may
hear."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that old Grice's mind was easy in regard
to himself he was much concerned about
Robert.</p>

<p>"Doan yo' feel bad, Mistah Drake. The
commerdan' will think yo' is a smart young
gemman when yo' report this; he won' think
yo' had nuffin' to do with it yo'self. I'ze
gwine ter tell him I couldn't hev detected the
gemmen ef it hadn't been fer yo', an' he'll
give yo' Mistah Stonewell's five stripes, suah
as yo' is bawn, he will, suh."</p>

<p>Grice rolled his eyes in ecstasy. He
imagined he too would receive praise and reward
for what he had done, and now he was
quite happy.</p>

<p>"Shut up," cried Robert, annoyed beyond
endurance at his rambling. And without another
word, or so much as a glance at Grice,
he slowly walked away and returned to his
room. He feared yet hoped he might find
Stonewell there. "If I could only see Stone,"
he thought, "I'd surely learn some excuse for
him. But why did he do this? Why did he
pretend to go to Washington? Why should
he engage in such an affair with Harry
Blunt?" Countless other questions crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
themselves into Robert's mind, but to not one
could he find a suitable answer.</p>

<p>He found his room empty, nor was there
any evidence that Stonewell had been there.
Robert paced restlessly up and down the room
in troubled thought, and as the minutes
dragged on he grew more and more hopeless.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm done for, as well as Stone and
Harry Blunt. I suppose Grice will report this
matter, and I'll be called up; I'll have to
give my evidence against Stone and Blunt or
else be bilged myself. Well, I'll bilge. I
can't help what Stone has done; I could never
be happy if my evidence were to dismiss him.
As for that Blunt, who got him into this&mdash;well,
he's the son of Captain Blunt, and
Helen's brother. I never could convince
them I was not an ungrateful cur. No,
Stone and I will both bilge together; but I
wonder if Stone isn't now in Blunt's room&mdash;&mdash;"
and Robert stopped short.</p>

<p>It was now after midnight, and all the midshipmen
were back from having escorted their
partners to their homes. Robert looked out in
the corridor and saw that the midshipman in
charge of the floor had left his desk.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"The men on duty are turned in; I'll go
to Blunt's room and see if Stone is there."</p>

<p>Robert darted through the corridor. Turning
a corner near where Harry Blunt's room
was he saw that young man just entering it.
Robert jumped in after him.</p>

<p>"Where is Stonewell?" he savagely demanded.</p>

<p>When Blunt saw who his midnight visitor
was he was visibly startled.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;how should I know?" he
stammered.</p>

<p>"You hound, you&mdash;&mdash;" cried Robert. "Tell
me where Stonewell is! Do you hear me?
Tell me where Stonewell is!" And Robert
seized him by both arms.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I haven't seen him for
some time," faltered Harry Blunt, with a
white face, in which fear was but too plainly
depicted.</p>

<p>From the overhead transom light from a
corridor lamp streamed in, and on the table
in the room were three burning candles.</p>

<p>Robert looked suspiciously at Harry. In
the latter's arms was a bundle of clothing.
Robert suddenly grabbed this and opened it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
up. It was composed of a dark sack coat, out
of which two articles fell to the floor. Robert
picked them up and instantly recognized them.
One was a brown slouch hat and the other a
false beard. In an agony of bitterness and
hate Robert completely lost control of himself.
He grabbed Harry and shook him
violently and then dashed him against the
wall.</p>

<p>"You contemptible cur," he cried. "For
the last time, will you tell me where Stonewell
is?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," sullenly replied Harry.</p>

<p>"Do you expect to see him again to-night?"</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>Robert looked at him utterly without belief.</p>

<p>"Drake," implored Harry, "if you report
me for this you will bilge me; you know how
that will affect my people; I suppose it is
your duty to report me, but if you do only
one thing can happen to me. I will be dismissed;
you know that as well as I do."</p>

<p>Robert looked at him with contempt, and
left the room.</p>

<p>The long night passed slowly, but it brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
no sleep or rest to the overwrought nerves
of Robert. He went to bed and tossed about
in an agony.</p>

<p>"Oh, that Stonewell would only come,"
was Robert's thought, repeated countless
times. But Stonewell did not come. The
moonlight faded away; the silence was broken
only by the striking of bells and the monotonous
call of sentries. The first gleam of
dawn found Robert still wide awake, hopeless
and dejected. Mechanically he prepared his
room and himself for Sunday inspection.
Finally reveille was sounded, the gun thundered
and Bancroft Hall burst into life. Later
came breakfast formation and Robert, against
his inclination, had to mix with the other
midshipmen.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Bob?" inquired Peters,
with friendly concern; "you're not looking
well."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm all right," impatiently answered
Robert. Then came breakfast, which seemed
interminable. Robert sat at his table's head
longing for the order "rise." Food would
have choked him; he gulped down a cup of
coffee, and sat idly drumming the table.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>After breakfast Glassfell came up to him.
"Look here, Bob, what's bothering you?" he
asked with real solicitude. "You're not
yourself this morning, old chap. What's the
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Have you seen Stonewell?" abruptly
asked Robert.</p>

<p>"By jingo!" exclaimed Glassfell. "Last
night I could have sworn I saw Stonewell pass
me. I was on Main Street, and a midshipman
with some stripes, and I thought a good
many, passed me in a great hurry and turned
into Conduit Street. It was dark and yet at
the time I had no thought but that it was
Stonewell. 'Hello, Stone!' I called out; 'I
thought you were in Washington;' but the
fellow paid no attention to me. He seemed
to be in a hurry, almost running. Then I
concluded I must have been mistaken, because
I knew Stone was in Washington, and it was
pretty dark. The thing bothered me a bit
for the time, but I must have been mistaken.
I had taken my partner home from the
Armory and was on my way back. It was
about half-past eleven, I think. But why
do you ask me about Stone? He won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
be back from Washington until ten this morning."</p>

<p>"If you see him tell him I'm looking for
him," and Robert turned away. He now
wanted to be by himself. He went in one of the
wing corridors and looked out of the window,
hardly replying to different salutations of midshipmen
who passed him. Outside it was raining,
one of those tenacious rains that seem determined
to last throughout the day. Overhead
were spread heavy dark forbidding clouds;
the day was gloomy and hopeless, but not
nearly so much so as felt this midshipman.</p>

<p>After a while one stroke of the bell told
Robert it was half-past eight, and soon he saw
the commandant's tall form, wrapped up in
a great rubber coat, come down the walk.
Some time later he saw two figures emerge
from the trees that line the main walk; one
he recognized as that of Commander Beckwith,
the head of the Department of Mathematics,
the other, of low figure and shambling
walk, he instantly recognized as that of old
Grice. With throbbing heart, Robert watched
them until they disappeared into the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>mandant's
office; then the cadet lieutenant
went to his room.</p>

<p>It was evident to him that Grice had told
his story to Commander Beckwith and the
latter was now talking with the commandant
about it. Robert waited for the summons he
knew was coming, to appear before the commandant.
Thoughts came surging through
his brain. Sooner than testify against Stonewell
he would accept dismissal. And likewise,
in spite of his bitter dislike toward
Harry Blunt, before he would bring disgrace
upon the dear friends who had done so much
for him, he would accept dismissal. Robert,
with a steady mind, without hesitation, determined
on this stand. He now knew his
last moment of inaction had arrived. Not
that he had any hope or expectation of saving
either Stonewell or Blunt, but that he should
be the means of their disgrace and dismissal
was an unbearable thought. It were far better
to bilge.</p>

<p>Steps were heard in the corridor and Farnum
appeared at his door.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bob," he said, "the commandant
wants to see you right away. He's in his office."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Farnum, I'll start in a moment."
And then taking a sheet of official
paper, and hurriedly heading it, he wrote:</p>

<p>"I hereby tender my resignation as a midshipman
in the naval service."</p>

<p>This he signed, and with it in his hand he
walked down the corridor, and was soon standing
before the commandant.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="center">IT WAS STONEWELL</p>


<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Drake," said the commandant,
pleasantly enough. "I'm surprised
that you haven't been to me with a report before
now&mdash;that is, unless Grice has made some
great mistake. He has told me that you and
he caught two midshipmen last night attempting
to steal an examination&mdash;he says he knows
who they are, but seems afraid to give their
names. Who are they, Mr. Drake?"</p>

<p>Commander Dalton was grave and impassive.
He spoke to Robert as one officer might
to another on an official matter; his manner
betokened an expectation on his part of receiving
an absolutely frank report from the
cadet lieutenant.</p>

<p>Instead of making any reply Robert approached
the desk at which the commandant
was sitting and handed him a folded sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>"Who were the midshipmen, Mr. Drake?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Or did you fail to recognize them?" And
then after a pause, with a trace of annoyance
in his voice due to Robert's backwardness in
answering his questions, "Or is Grice's report
incorrect?"</p>

<p>He looked at Robert with surprise as the
latter made no effort whatever to reply. He
then opened the paper and cried out in amazement:
"You tender your resignation as a midshipman?
What does this mean, sir? I have
asked you certain questions which you do not
answer, and then you resign. Come, Mr.
Drake, explain yourself, sir! First tell me if
Grice's statement is correct. Do you refuse to
answer, sir?"</p>

<p>Still Robert was silent; he looked at the
commandant with gloomy, troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake, are you aware of what you are
doing? Don't you know that persistence in
this course will cause your summary dismissal?"</p>

<p>"Don't dismiss him, capting," cried out old
Grice, now in great trouble about Robert.
"He's a fine young gemman, 'deed he is, suh.
I'll tell yo' who dese young gemmen wuz; he
doan' want to tell yo', but I'll tell yo', capting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
suh; dey wuz Mistah Stonewell and Mistah
Harry Blunt, suh. I seed 'em, suh, and Mistah
Drake seed 'em, and Mistah Drake doan' want
ter tole yo', suh, becase&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The commandant jumped from his chair as
if he had been shot. "What are you talking
about? You're demented!" he roughly cried.
"Do you know who you are talking about?
Do you know that Mr. Stonewell is cadet commander?
Grice, you must be crazy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, suh, capting, suh; beggin' yo' pardin,
suh, dat's why I didn't tole yo' befoah, suh.
I knowed you'd say ole Grice wuz surely
crazy; but de fax am, capting, that Mistah
Stonewell, in his unerform&mdash;I counted de five
gold stripes on his sleeve, suh, at de time&mdash;and
Mistah Harry Blunt, the son of de ole
commerdan', at 'bout 'leven 'clock las' night
tried to steal a zamnation. I seed dem try,
and Mistah Drake, he seen 'em try ter steal it.
An' ef yo' doan' believe me, capting, yo' ask
Mistah Drake; he knows Mistah Stonewell
tried to steal the zamnation 'kase he seen
him. Yo' ask Mistah Drake, capting."</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake," cried Commander Dalton,
"you have heard this monstrous charge; I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
waiting for your indignant denial! Why are
you silent? Are you mute, when you hear
the character of the first midshipman of his
time so shamefully assailed? You shall
answer me! Do you understand that this
negro says that you and he together saw Mr.
Stonewell and Mr. Blunt attempt to steal an
examination last night? Do you hear that,
and are you silent, sir?"</p>

<p>Commander Dalton's manner was vehement
and intimidating. "What have you to say,
sir?" he thundered, slamming a clinched fist
with a bang on his desk.</p>

<p>With parched lips and in trembling accents
Robert commenced to speak. Four years of
the strictest training urged him to yield to the
commandant's order; but Robert had expected
this and had tried to prepare himself for it.</p>

<p>"As I have handed in my resignation, sir,"
he faltered, "I respectfully request that I be
not asked any questions. This is all I can say,
sir." The commandant dropped into his
chair; he looked sorrowfully at Robert, and
then in an altered tone said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake, you and Mr. Stonewell are
close friends, are you not?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has been more to me than a brother
could have been, sir," replied Robert, in a
broken voice. And then in an effort to control
his feelings he turned his back on the
commandant and with blinding tears in his
eyes looked through the window in front of
him at the mournful, steady rain without.</p>

<p>Captain Dalton picked up a telephone and
said, "Central, give me number twenty-seven.
Hello, is this Captain Blunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the commandant of midshipmen."</p>

<p>"Blunt, can you come to my office immediately?
A most serious charge has been made
against your son."</p>

<p>Then he rang for his orderly and said:
"Tell the officer-in-charge I won't inspect this
morning, and tell him to send Midshipman
Blunt to my office immediately."</p>

<p>When Harry Blunt walked in the office, instead
of his usual debonair manner, there was
a look of worry and anxiety on his face.</p>

<p>"Wait a few minutes, Mr. Blunt. Beckwith,
excuse me while I write something."</p>

<p>Harry Blunt glanced at Robert and at the
others; several times he looked as if he were
about to say something, but he did not.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before Captain Blunt appeared;
he jumped out of an automobile that
had stopped before the Academy steps, and
fairly ran up them and into the commandant's
office. Commander Dalton rose to greet him
with a worried expression.</p>

<p>"Captain Blunt," he began, "a week ago
Mr. Drake reported to me that Grice informed
him two midshipmen were planning to steal
an examination in mathematics; I told Mr.
Drake to ascertain who these midshipmen were
if he could. This morning Grice reported to
his department head, Beckwith, that he and
Mr. Drake had caught two midshipmen in
the act of stealing this examination. Grice
was afraid to tell who they were; he said Mr.
Drake could. I sent for Mr. Drake and asked
him who they were, and if Grice's statement
was true. Instead of replying Mr. Drake
hands me this paper. Read it. Then Grice
made the most astounding statement I have
ever heard. He says the midshipmen were Mr.
Stonewell and Mr. Harry Blunt."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Captain Blunt.</p>

<p>"And when Grice made this statement Mr.
Drake remained silent, and he still remains so."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impossible!" again exclaimed Captain
Blunt, in an agony of spirit. "Harry, my boy,
say it is false."</p>

<p>"He cain't, Capting Blunt, he cain't, becase
I seed him; an' Mistah Drake, he seed him
too, suh," broke in old Grice, feeling that he
had to substantiate his charge. "Mr. Stonewell
was in unerform, suh. Mr. Harry Blunt
wuz in citerzens' close; he had on an ole brown
hat and he wore whiskers, but I knowed him;
I done seen Mr. Harry afore in dem same
close."</p>

<p>"When and where?" demanded Commander
Dalton.</p>

<p>"In Capting Blunt's kitchen, suh; I wuz
er passin' by the house at night when all midshipmen
is supposed to be studyin', and I seed
a man in the kitchen. I seed him take off
dem whiskers and de hat an' I seed it wuz
Mr. Harry Blunt. Yo' ask him, suh. An' I
seed him 'nother time, suh. Capting, yo'
'member that time at de theatre, heah, when
a man stood up in a box an' says, 'Three groans
for de superintendent an' commandan''?
Dat wuz Mistah Harry Blunt too, suh; I wuz
dar. I didn't know it at de time, but when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
seen Mistah Harry in Capting Blunt's kitchen
I knowed it then, 'cose he had on de same hat
an' coat an' whiskers. Ef yo' doan' believe
me yo' ask him, suh; an' las' night Mistah
Stonewell calls him Harry. I heard him an'
Mistah Drake heard him. An' ef yo' looks in
Mistah Harry Blunt's room I spect yo'll find
them whiskers an' coat."</p>

<p>Beads of perspiration burst out on Captain
Blunt's forehead. He tried to speak, but his
voice choked in his throat. That this disgrace
was to come upon him after a lifetime of
honorable service in the navy was hard, but
that the pride and hope of his life, his son
Harry, could be guilty of so vile an act, was
an unbearable thought; he looked at Harry.
Frightened and appealing, the latter cried:
"Father, I deny that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep still; don't say a word," called out
Captain Blunt; then turning to the commandant
he said: "My son is in a terrible position,
Dalton; he might be tempted to falsehood.
I want to save him from that, at least.
Before we go any further I want to ask you to
have his room searched&mdash;I would like to be
present when it is."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>The commandant sent for the officer-in-charge,
and directed him to take a cadet officer
and search Harry Blunt's room. Captain
Blunt left with the officer-in-charge. It was
not long before they returned, and the cadet
officer carried with him a bundle composed
of a citizen's coat, hat and trousers, and a false
beard.</p>

<p>"Put them on," ordered Captain Blunt,
harshly, to his son. The latter did so mechanically.</p>

<p>"Will you please send for some midshipman
who was at the theatre that night?"</p>

<p>"All of the first class were there, and most
of the officers. I'll send for Mr. Farnum and
Mr. Blair."</p>

<p>When these two midshipmen came in, Captain
Blunt said: "Take a look at this man;
have you ever seen him before?"</p>

<p>Blair and Farnum recognized him immediately.
The heavy dark pointed beard and
moustache once seen were not likely to be forgotten,
particularly when seen under such
startling circumstances as they first had been
at the theatre on the night Penfield played
Richard the Third.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's the man who gave three groans for
the superintendent and commandant," cried
Farnum, excitedly.</p>

<p>"He's the man, sir; there is no doubt of it,"
said Blair.</p>

<p>"That will do, gentlemen," returned the
commandant; "you will not speak of this to
any one."</p>

<p>Captain Blunt sat up straight and rigid in
his chair; his face had turned an ashen gray.
The greatest sorrow of his life was upon him.
"Mr. Drake," he said after a moment, "have
you ever seen my son in this disguise? Did
you detect him trying to steal an examination?
I wish a direct answer." His voice
sounded strange and harsh.</p>

<p>"I have resigned, sir; I request to be excused
from answering any questions," was
Robert's reply.</p>

<p>Commander Dalton looked sorrowfully at
his brother officer, but made no comment,
while Harry Blunt regarded Robert with intense
surprise, stupefaction, fear and amazement.</p>

<p>Robert, inert and dull, gazing idly out of the
window, suddenly gave a start and looked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
with interest and expectancy as the office door
was opened, and a midshipman entered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px;">
<img src="images/i005.png" width="478" height="700" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>"THAT WILL DO, GENTLEMEN"</i></span></span>
</div>

<p>"Good-morning, sir," said the newcomer;
"I have to report my return from two days'
leave."</p>

<p>The midshipman was Stonewell.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="center">JOHN 15:13</p>


<p>With Stonewell's entrance came a silence
that was positively painful. The commandant
looked at him with undisguised
loathing. In Captain Blunt's face woe unutterable
was clearly depicted. Harry Blunt,
pale and uneasy, regarded him with frightened
glance. Robert Drake looked at Stonewell
with fascinated gaze; he felt that now
the end of all things at the Naval Academy
was to happen.</p>

<p>Stonewell, clear-eyed and calm as usual,
looked at Robert, and then slowly his eyes
traveled and rested upon each person in the
room. Never had Stonewell appeared better.
In his dignified bearing there was not a single
trace of fear or worry. No response was
made to his salutation or report. Again he
glanced about the room, and getting no response
inquired, "What is the matter? Am I
intruding?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" cried the commandant.
"Have you the effrontery to ask what
the matter is?"</p>

<p>"I beg to be so informed," replied Stonewell
coolly, after a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>"Read this paper, sir. Do you not know
why Mr. Drake has offered his resignation?"</p>

<p>Stonewell read the paper; then looked
keenly at Robert, then at Captain Blunt and
Harry; things seemed to explain themselves
and he merely said, "Ah," as if it were in response
to some unspoken thought of his own.</p>

<p>"Where were you last night at eleven
o'clock, Mr. Stonewell?"</p>

<p>"In Washington, sir; I spent the day in
Princeton, New Jersey, and returned to Washington
at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>An angry exclamation left the commandant's
lips. Again his closed fist banged the
desk.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stonewell!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Last night, shortly after eleven o'clock,
Mr. Drake and this man Grice caught two
midshipmen in the act of stealing an examination.
Mr. Drake knows who these midship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>men
are, but resigns rather than give their
names. But we know them. One of these
midshipmen was disguised. Mr. Blunt, put
on your false beard and your hat."</p>

<p>Harry Blunt did so, shamefacedly enough.</p>

<p>"Look at this man; have you ever seen him
before?" thundered the commandant, in
scornful tones, leaning over his desk.</p>

<p>Stonewell looked at Harry, then at Robert,
and then at Captain Blunt. Again Stonewell
said "Ah," and further remarked, "Now I
understand."</p>

<p>"Answer my question, sir," fairly shouted
Commander Dalton. "Did you ever before
see a person who looked as Mr. Blunt does
now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. The man who gave three groans
for the superintendent and commandant that
night in the Colonial Theatre was evidently
Mr. Blunt in disguise. I didn't know it at the
time, but evidently my roommate did. This
accounts for his past inveterate hostility to Mr.
Blunt. He never told me about it, and I have
been puzzled at his strong dislike for Mr.
Blunt. From what you have said I imagine
that Mr. Blunt was one of the two midship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>men
caught by Mr. Drake. I now see what
the trouble is. Mr. Drake will not tell because
of his gratitude to Captain Blunt."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stonewell," burst out the commandant,
"have you descended to the bottom of the pit
of hypocrisy and infamy? Do you add lying
to your other crimes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Do I add lying to my other crimes?" repeated
Stonewell. "These are strange questions,
Captain Dalton; will you please tell me
in what way I have been infamous and a
hypocrite? What are those other crimes, and
in what respect have I lied?" Indignation
with ringing force was in Stonewell's voice as
he looked steadily and unflinchingly at the
commandant.</p>

<p>"Grice," said Captain Dalton, turning to the
negro, "did you and Mr. Drake see Mr. Blunt
trying to steal an examination last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," eagerly replied Grice; "we done
catched him, suh, an' Mistah Stonewell was
with him, suh; Mistah Drake wasn't six feet
from Mistah Stonewell when I turned on de
'lectric light, suh; dere ain't no mistake, capting.
Mistah Harry Blunt was dere disguised,
but I knowed 'im. An' Mistah Stonewell was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
dere; he wuz in his unerform, gold stripes an'
all."</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake," said the commandant turning
to Robert, "I will once more order you either
to deny that Mr. Stonewell was there last
night or to admit it."</p>

<p>Robert looked at his beloved friend. Never
had Stonewell appeared more manly, more
forceful. Character and greatness of soul
seemed to radiate from him, and it almost
seemed that midshipman though he was, the
others present were dwarfed into insignificance.</p>

<p>With unmoved expression and with a clear,
straightforward gaze Stonewell returned Robert's
look, and smiled; smiled as though to assure
him that all was well; Robert felt pity
mingle with his deep affection for his erring
friend, and confused as he was and knowing
that Stonewell was guilty, there was yet something
so noble, so fearless in Stonewell's bearing
that a hope leaped up in him that his
friend was not without some justification for
his act, impossible as it was to imagine what
it could be.</p>

<p>"Do you deny that you detected Mr. Stonewell
last night trying to steal an examination?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"As I have resigned I respectfully request
to be excused from answering questions,"
replied Robert in a breaking voice.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stonewell, I shall recommend your
immediate dismissal for scandalous conduct,
and you too, Mr. Blunt. Mr. Drake will be
dismissed for disobedience of orders. Mr.
Stonewell, your crimes have found you out.
You, the most esteemed midshipman of your
time, have turned out to be but a sorry
hypocrite, an impostor. You, a shameful, dishonorable
man to wear a naval uniform, to
represent your country? Never! Oh, that
I had never come to this place! What is to
be hoped for our navy when the midshipman
we are most proud of turns out to be a
hypocrite and a cheat?"</p>

<p>The commandant spoke with, warm, intense
feeling. He paused for a moment, and then
contemptuously said: "You are as brazen as
you are false. Your position was so high that
I cannot imagine what could have induced
you, even though you are devoid of honor, to
have so acted. And now that you are found
out I cannot help but wonder&mdash;I would like
to know what excuse, what explanation you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
can offer, and what your thoughts are at this
moment."</p>

<p>While the commandant spoke, Stonewell
stood proudly erect before him. He neither
cringed nor for a moment took his eyes from
the commandant's face. Over at one side stood
Robert, now utterly collapsed.</p>

<p>Stonewell fearlessly looked the commandant
through and through, and then he looked at
Robert. There was almost a break in his
voice when in tones showing not a trace of resentment
for the commandant's scathing, contemptuous
words, but instead full of unutterable
affection, he said softly to the commandant,
but looking at Robert: "I cannot tell
you what my thoughts at this moment are,
sir, but I will tell Drake later."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="center">COMMANDER DALTON BECOMES ANGRY</p>


<p>"This matter isn't settled yet, sir," continued
Stonewell. "A man accused has a right to
offer a defense: I insist on that right. First,
I am not guilty. I shall have no trouble in
proving my innocence. I shall leave your
office for a few minutes and will return with
the proof of that innocence. And as I have
been charged with scandalous acts in the
presence of everybody here in your office, I
have to request that they all remain until I
return and that no further action be taken until
I am back."</p>

<p>"Just a moment, Mr. Stonewell," called out
the commandant, but the former, paying no
attention to this order, hurriedly left the office.</p>

<p>Commander Dalton looked undecided. "I
don't understand this at all. Mr. Stonewell
should not have left at this time."</p>

<p>"I think you had better let him go, Dal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>ton;
he is entitled to present a defense if he
has one," observed Captain Blunt.</p>

<p>"Of course, but he had the opportunity
right here; Blunt, do you wish to question
your son?"</p>

<p>"After Mr. Stonewell returns I would like a
chance to talk privately with Harry and with
Mr. Drake."</p>

<p>"Father," started Harry Blunt, appealingly,
"I will admit that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, will you?" interrupted his
father fiercely. "Dalton, I don't want my
boy to say a word. Look at him; he is entirely
unstrung, and in his condition I fear he
may be tempted to untruth. Bad as things
are, I must save him from that if I can."</p>

<p>"Father," pleaded Harry, imploringly,
"let me speak&mdash;I deny that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harry, don't say a word. There is no
hurry about this; Dalton, have you any objection
to my having a private talk now with
my son?"</p>

<p>"None at all, Captain Blunt. Take him
into this rear office."</p>

<p>When the captain passed Robert on his way
to the rear office, he said to him sadly: "Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Drake, don't hesitate to tell the facts; you
have proved you will not tell an untruth, that
you will resign sooner than do so. But don't
spoil your whole career by trying to defend
one so unworthy as my son has proved to be.
And if you have any notion, as implied by Mr.
Stonewell's words, that you are under obligations
to me, I assure you there is no such debt;
and even if you feel that there is one, I freely
absolve you from it. Come, Mr. Drake, have
you seen Harry in that disguise? Was he the
one guilty of that shameful insult to the superintendent
and commandant? Did you detect
a person in that disguise in the act of
stealing an examination last night? These
are now my questions, Mr. Drake, not the
commandant's; I beg of you to answer them
frankly."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain Blunt," replied
Robert, huskily; "but I have resigned, and
I request to be excused from answering questions."
Captain Blunt passed out of the room
with his son. Commander Beckwith now excused
himself for a few minutes, and there remained
in the room only Robert, Grice and
the commandant. The latter busied himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
writing, with never a glance at Robert. Old
Grice rolled his eyes, fearfully apprehending
some disaster to himself.</p>

<p>All the midshipmen were out of the building,
and absolute stillness, save for the mournful
tick-tock of the clock, reigned in Bancroft
Hall. Outside the rain came down steadily,
and Robert Drake felt burdened with a hopeless
sadness. He now fully realized that his
silence would in no way help or save Stonewell
or Harry Blunt; that its only result
would be his own dismissal; and yet there
was not in his mind any tinge of regret that
he had refused to disclose what he knew.
Better to go out and commence over again
than to stay in by taking part in the disgrace
of Stonewell and Captain Blunt's son. In regard
to Stonewell, Robert's mind was in a
state of disordered confusion. Stonewell's
manner and bearing were at utter variance
with the idea of guilt; as much so as had been
his previous character. And it was inconceivable
that anything imaginable could have
induced him to steal an examination. And
so the long minutes passed with Robert's mind
going through a bewildered maze.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Commander Beckwith was the first to return,
saying as he came in the door: "I have been
with the officer-in-charge; but I see Mr. Stonewell
is returning; he'll be here in a moment."</p>

<p>"Come in the office, please," called out the
commandant, to Captain Blunt, and when
the latter returned accompanied by Harry, he
looked about as bewildered and perplexed as
he did before he left.</p>

<p>When Stonewell left the commandant's office
it was at a dead run. Outside of Bancroft
Hall he gave no heed to the "Keep-off-the-grass"
signs; he plunged over the lawn toward
Maryland Avenue gate at more than
football speed. Just outside the gate was a
public automobile. He jumped into it crying:
"Conduit Street. Rush for your life;
I'll double your fare."</p>

<p>When Stonewell returned to the commandant's
office, he was followed by another
young man in midshipman's uniform. And
strange to say the young man's coat had five
golden stripes on his sleeve&mdash;strange because
there is but one cadet commander at a time
at the Naval Academy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Captain, this is my brother, Frank Stonewell,"
said Stonewell simply.</p>

<p>"Your brother, Frank Stonewell!" ejaculated
Commander Dalton, in tones of stupefied
amazement, "Your brother, Frank
Stonewell!" he repeated in the same manner.
He looked at Stonewell and then at his
brother Frank and was speechless.</p>

<p>"Oh, Stone!" cried Robert Drake, with
joy radiating his face. "Oh, Stone, how
could I have doubted you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake, I don't blame you for mistaking
Mr. Frank Stonewell for his brother; if
that is what you did," finally said the commandant;
for the likeness of the two brothers
was marvelous, and the resemblance even
extended to the tones of their voices. They
were of the same height and build. Frank
Stonewell had the same expression, the same
features as had his brother. Seeing them together
one could detect a difference, but apart
one would certainly be taken for the other.</p>

<p>"I was in Washington last night, sir. I
spent the night at the house of my congressman,
Mr. Blake. We were talking together
between ten and eleven o'clock. You will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
have no trouble in ascertaining whether or
not this statement is correct. My brother
was in Annapolis at that time. He has been
here for some weeks, living in Conduit Street.
I have not told him why he was wanted here
nor have we talked about what may have
happened last night. Perhaps he may
imagine. Whatever he may have done, I
believe you may accept his statement as
truthful."</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me, sir, what you are
doing in that uniform?" demanded the
commandant in a stern tone.</p>

<p>"I was sitting in my room when my
brother John bolted in and pulled me out in
a rush. He gave me no time to change."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that uniform?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's John's. He has come out frequently
to see me and brought it over one
day. It's much more comfortable to sit
about in than that bobtailed stiff jacket midshipmen
wear."</p>

<p>"Humph! Two midshipmen were seen
stealing an examination last night. One was
recognized to be your brother. What have
you to say to that, sir?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you believe that, sir?"</p>

<p>"I believe it to such an extent that I told
him he would be dismissed from the Naval
Academy for scandalous crimes. I accused
him also of lying and of being a shameless
hypocrite."</p>

<p>"I think you have an apology to make,
captain, if that is your title," remarked
Frank Stonewell, in great good nature.
"John was in Washington last night. And
John isn't that kind of a fellow; evidently
you don't know him."</p>

<p>"Well, if your brother didn't do it, then
you did."</p>

<p>"You may find some trouble in proving
that."</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake, was this the man you saw last
night?" shouted the commandant angrily to
Robert.</p>

<p>Before he had finished his question, Stonewell
said quickly to his brother, in a low imperative
tone: "Acknowledge it, Frank.
Don't force Drake either to refuse to answer
or to tell on you."</p>

<p>"I was the man, I acknowledge it,"
quickly interposed Frank Stonewell.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are a brother to be proud of, aren't
you?" announced the commandant scornfully.
"In your brother's absence, donning
his uniform, you committed a despicable act,
trusting if caught that his uniform and the
marked resemblance you bear to him would
throw the blame and shame on him."</p>

<p>"Not at all, captain," replied Frank Stonewell,
in an easy manner as one talking socially
with a friend; and it was a sharp contrast to
the deference and crisp military replies of the
others. "Not at all; you mistake the purpose
of my wearing his uniform. It was to permit
me to be about the grounds and buildings at
night; as a civilian the watchmen would have
fired me out; but rigged up in this way I
would never be questioned. And as for
throwing blame or shame on him; before he
came for me this morning I knew I might
have been seen and mistaken for him. No
blame could come to him because I have been
ready to acknowledge the facts."</p>

<p>"You are brazen, sir; you have done a
shameful deed, you have disgraced your
brother. But I am glad to know that the
shame I thought was his belongs to you. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
am indeed relieved to know he is guiltless. I
pity him for the burden of disgrace in having
such a brother."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, captain. This is something of
an academic question. What may be shameful
for John or any other midshipman is not
necessarily so to a civilian owing no allegiance
to your Naval Academy. I have
never lied or cheated, I have never broken a
promise&mdash;I have never done a dishonorable
act. I admit having engaged in some quiet
larks at college, and other places&mdash;this is one
of them, that's all."</p>

<p>"You are a burglar; you could be sent to
prison."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think not, captain; I think you'd
have hard work to convince any jury of
that."</p>

<p>The commandant was furious; Frank Stonewell
was cool and entirely self-possessed and
not at all intimidated. None of the others
present attempted to say a word. Robert
Drake listened with absorbing interest. A
great load had been lifted from him, and in
spite of his own unfortunate position great
happiness had suddenly come to him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
knowledge that John Stonewell's character was
as clean and true as he had always believed
it to be.</p>

<p>"If you have cleared your brother, Mr.
Frank Stonewell, there is one person you cannot
clear, and that is the contemptible midshipman
who was with you," vehemently exclaimed
the commandant.</p>

<p>Frank Stonewell was silent.</p>

<p>"Do you deny, sir, that a midshipman accompanied
you last night?"</p>

<p>"I will answer only such questions as concern
myself," replied Frank decidedly.</p>

<p>"I know your companion, sir, and I'll show
him to you." And turning abruptly toward
Harry Blunt he exclaimed, "Come over here,
and let Mr. Frank Stonewell look at you."</p>

<p>As Frank looked up into Harry Blunt's
face, he said coolly enough, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Who is he?" almost shouted Commander
Dalton. "Do you mean to say you don't know
who he is?"</p>

<p>"I never saw him before in my life. What
has he to do with this matter?"</p>

<p>"He's Harry, the Harry you spoke to last
night."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"Harry? Harry who? I never spoke to
him in my life."</p>

<p>"He's the Harry of the false beard, the
Harry who proposed three groans for the
superintendent and commandant, the Harry
who accompanied you last night, for whom
you tried to steal an examination."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think not. I don't know who this
chap is; he was not with me last night; I
never saw him before. Look here, captain, I
hope you navigate better than you investigate,"
rejoined Frank Stonewell, in a disgusted
tone; "if you don't I fear you will bump into
every rock that is hanging about loose."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stonewell," said Commander Dalton
to the cadet commander, "you told me your
brother would speak the truth. Now, Mr.
Frank Stonewell," he continued, "your companion
was a midshipman disguised in this
beard and with this coat and hat on. He was
recognized by this colored man who had seen
Mr. Harry Blunt at one time remove this disguise.
There is every reason to believe that
Mr. Drake had previously seen Mr. Blunt in
this disguise. Mr. Drake evidently believed
he saw your brother last night, and also Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Blunt, but he has refused to answer about
either, for which he will be dismissed. I will
add that this disguise was found in Mr.
Blunt's room. Now, what have you to say
about this matter?"</p>

<p>Frank, with all the appearance of keen interest,
listened to the commandant. "I would
say that Drake is a bully good chap," he burst
out enthusiastically, "a fellow to tie to; this
must be a queer place if you fire such a fellow
for standing by a chum. John has told me
that Drake was the very best fellow who ever
lived," he ran on. "I guess he's all right,"
and Frank looked over at Robert and gave
him a friendly nod.</p>

<p>The commandant looked the rage he felt
and no doubt would have liked to inflict the
punishment of double irons upon this insolent,
effervescent trifler. He darted an extinguishing
glance upon him and turned toward Captain
Blunt and said:</p>

<p>"Captain Blunt, I can get nothing from this
man. Do you wish to ask him any questions?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed, Dalton. Mr. Stonewell, Mr.
Blunt is my son. He stands accused of having
attempted, while in your company, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
while in this disguise, to steal an examination.
My son admits that the disguise is his property,
and has been for months; but he most solemnly
assures me he was not with you last night,
that he was not out of this building after
seven o'clock. For this offense, of which you
say he is guiltless, he stands recommended to
be dismissed. Now I call upon you to state
who was the man that was with you."</p>

<p>"Your son was not with me; I shall make
no further statement than that."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you would allow an
innocent person to be punished?"</p>

<p>"I mean I will tell the truth. I never saw
your son to my knowledge till I entered this
office. If after my statement the authorities
dismiss him the fault is theirs, not mine. I
should regret to see this done, but I shall not
try to find somebody to take his place."</p>

<p>"But how do you account for my son being
recognized as the person with you?"</p>

<p>Frank Stonewell seized the hat and beard
and quickly hooked the latter over his ears.
He then suddenly assumed a bent-over position
and leaning over toward Grice said: "Did
you ever see me before?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fer goodness' sake, suh, I does berlieve
yo' wuz de young gemman in dose whiskers."</p>

<p>Tossing the hat and beard to one side Frank
Stonewell laughed and said: "It was the
beard and hat that were recognized, not your
son, sir." Hardly had he spoken when the
door of the commandant's office opened, and
a midshipman entered unannounced.</p>

<p>"What is it, sir? Why do you enter my
office without permission?" inquired the
commandant.</p>

<p>"I think I'm needed in this investigation,
sir," replied the midshipman, a tall, broad-shouldered
young man, athletic of build, of
rather pleasant features, and with stern resolution
written in his face.</p>

<p>"I am Midshipman Bligh of the fourth
class."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="center">ROBERT FINALLY ANSWERS</p>


<p>"What is it, sir?" demanded the commandant,
sternly, of Midshipman Bligh.</p>

<p>The latter hesitated for a moment, as if uncertain
how best to express himself.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;have heard that some&mdash;that some
civilian clothing and a false beard were found
in Mr. Blunt's room this morning&mdash;I learned
Mr. Blunt was in your office&mdash;and a little
while ago I saw Mr. Frank Stonewell come
into the building with his brother. I have
thought that perhaps Mr. Blunt is charged
with having used that disguise last night; is
that so, sir?"</p>

<p>"It is; what do you know about the affair,
sir?" returned the commandant, looking
fixedly at Bligh, while Frank Stonewell
regarded him with friendly approval in his
expressive face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blunt is not guilty, sir. I was in
possession last night of the things found this
morning in his room."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"And did you accompany Mr. Frank Stonewell
in an attempt to steal the examination
last night, sir?"</p>

<p>"I am guilty of having made that attempt,
sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blunt is also charged with being the
person who proposed the three groans for the
superintendent and commandant. Were you
guilty of that, too, sir?"</p>

<p>"I was, sir."</p>

<p>When Bligh said this Captain Blunt was
undoubtedly the happiest person in the room;
he seemed to relax from the strain and tension
he had been on for the past hour; and it is
likely that a more crestfallen young man
than Robert Drake would have been hard to
find. Relieved as the latter was, he felt
abjectly foolish. He had made a most needless
sacrifice; he had jumped to conclusions
and had been entirely wrong.</p>

<p>The commandant was silent for a few moments,
apparently lost in thought. He finally
remarked: "Mr. Bligh, do you know that
this confession of yours will cause your dismissal
from the Naval Academy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Bligh, simply.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose that you do this to save Mr.
Blunt; was this your reason?"</p>

<p>"That was only an incidental cause, sir; the
real reason was I wanted to do one decent
thing at the Naval Academy. I have done so
many things that I am not proud of; and I
want to justify Frank Stonewell's belief that
there is some good in me. I have had a hard
time here, sir. I commenced wrong, and I
have been punished severely&mdash;for months not
one single midshipman at the Academy has
spoken a friendly word to me. Then some
weeks ago I met Frank Stonewell, and somehow
I opened up my heart to him&mdash;I was in a
bad way at that time; but he made me feel I
was not hopelessly bad; it is hard lines, sir, to
be made an outcast, a pariah, by one's classmates."</p>

<p>"I see," remarked the commandant, a bit
unbelieving and skeptical; "apparently Mr.
Frank Stonewell stirred up the good that was
in you and the direct stirring up resulted in
your shameful act of last night. I sincerely
hope Mr. Frank Stonewell will not try to stir
up any more good at the Naval Academy.
But, Mr. Bligh, you at least seem disposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
tell the truth. I wish to get to the bottom of
this whole affair. Tell me how you got hold
of Mr. Blunt's disguise. Did he know of it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. My room is next to the divisional
officer's office, on the ground floor. Late one
night, months ago, while I was getting a glass
of water, I observed Mr. Blunt enter that
office. Two hours later I saw Mr. Blunt, in
disguise, come over the terrace and soon I saw
him leave the office. I didn't understand it at
first, but suddenly it flashed over me that Mr.
Blunt kept civilian clothes somewhere in his
divisional officer's office. Then I knew it was
Mr. Blunt in disguise, and not a civilian, who
had left and entered that office by the window.
So later I took a wax impression and had a
key made for the door of that office; I went in
one night and found on top of the wardrobe
(it is a regular midshipman's wardrobe) the
coat, hat and false beard,&mdash;well, that's about
all, sir. I used them several times besides
the twice you know of."</p>

<p>"That's enough, quite enough to dismiss you
from the Naval Academy. I am glad indeed
finally to have arrived at the facts. The one
thing I cannot understand is that after these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
shameful acts you should talk such twaddle
about wanting to prove there is some good in
you. Faugh! There's no good in a cheat,
and your attempt to steal that examination
was caused by a desire to cheat. You can't
convince me there's anything particularly
good in you by what you have done in the last
twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"I have no hope of convincing you of anything,
sir, except that I and not Midshipman
Blunt am guilty of the offenses charged to
him. If I have done that, sir, I am entirely
satisfied. I admit that my intention was to
cheat, but the purpose was to pass the examination,
not to pass higher than some rival. It
was pretty bad, but not so bad as for a midshipman
who is satisfactory to cheat for the
purpose of getting higher rank. Now as for
my purpose in coming before you&mdash;I don't
know of any way you could have proved, without
my own voluntary confession, that I and
not Mr. Blunt was guilty. Cadet Commander
Stonewell has spurned me. Mr. Blunt has repeatedly
treated me with contempt. This resulted
from my own unfortunate start here; I
don't say it wasn't my fault, but I do say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
I have been given no chance to retrieve myself.
Every one here seemed to be against
me&mdash;this was a new experience to me, sir.
Every day was full of bitterness and unhappiness.
I could not feel I was so entirely
worthless! The groans I proposed were a
bubbling over of this bitterness; it was not
personal to either the superintendent or yourself.
At a time when I was ready to do anything
vile Mr. Frank Stonewell got hold of
me and he has made a different man of me, at
least in my own feelings. I have a self-respect
now that I had been without for months. In
spite of last night's act, I submit, sir, that this
voluntary statement should show you I am
not entirely bad; and what is more important
to me, I believe it will prove to Mr. Frank
Stonewell that I am on the square."</p>

<p>"What is your purpose in telling me all of
this stuff, Mr. Bligh?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I want to get a fresh grip on myself; I
hope to live a self-respecting life, to make an
honorable place for myself in civil life.
Can't you see, sir, that I don't want the
stigma, the disgrace of dishonorable expulsion
from here just as I commence civil life? Sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
I request to be allowed to resign instead of
being dismissed. I want a chance, sir; I've
done mean things here, but even if it is the
last moment, I've repented; I've done what I
could to clear Mr. Blunt."</p>

<p>"There's something in what you say, Mr.
Bligh. I deprecate your wrong actions, but I
acknowledge you have shown the proper
spirit this morning. Now write out a statement
of just what your actions have been, and
append to it your resignation. I will endorse
this, giving you credit for your proper act of
this morning. Whether you will be allowed
to resign or be dismissed will be decided by the
superintendent. I regret you have had such
a hard time here; I should be pleased to learn
that from now on you will live a good life.
That will do, sir."</p>

<p>Bligh left the room.</p>

<p>"Not altogether bad, is he, captain?" remarked
Frank Stonewell, nodding approvingly
at the captain. "I knew he would
come up like a man when the time came."</p>

<p>"I'll have nothing to say to you, sir; I
consider your ideas of right and wrong have
but a shadowy boundary between them. I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
not detain you in my office any longer,"
snapped Commander Dalton.</p>

<p>"Good-day, sir," and with an easy, friendly
smile for all Frank Stonewell left.</p>

<p>The commandant drew a long breath.
"Now, Mr. Blunt," he said, "you are cleared
of the worst charges that have been made
against you; I desire you to make a frank
statement of your connection with that disguise."</p>

<p>"Captain, I owned it; the disguise is mine.
You know, sir, that midshipmen do lots of
things that are not discovered; if a fellow
would cheat or do anything dishonorable,
none of his classmates would speak to him;
but if he were to 'French' as I have done, he
would not lose caste. There are many offenses
here of a military nature that a midshipman
might commit which would be severely
punished by the authorities if he were detected,
and yet at which most midshipmen
would smile. Well, sir, I have never cheated
nor done anything dishonorable; but I did
have this disguise and 'Frenched' out in Annapolis
several times with it on. I did not
propose the three groans that night at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
theatre and I was not out of this building last
night after seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Captain Blunt," resumed the commandant,
"I don't mind saying that I am more
relieved than it is possible to express. Now,
Mr. Blunt, did you never fear detection? I am
rather interested in this matter."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Captain, do you remember the
Sunday morning you invited me to dine with
you?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed. I recall that at first you
were tongue-tied and acted queerly; then you
gushed out words that didn't have much
sense. That was the next day after the three
groans were proposed at the theatre. I remember
it well."</p>

<p>"The night before, sir, Saturday night, I
went after my disguise intending to use it,
and it was missing. When you called me up
I was scared; I thought I was found out.
Evidently Mr. Bligh had taken it, but I
didn't know or imagine he had."</p>

<p>"Who did you imagine had taken the
things?"</p>

<p>"I just couldn't imagine, except that some
servant might have stolen the disguise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
then thought better of it and put it back.
But no trouble came to me about it, so I
didn't worry."</p>

<p>"When you heard about the man in the
theatre proposing the three groans, didn't you
recognize from his description that it was
somebody with your disguise on?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, sir. People said it was some cit.
I never gave particular thought to that affair."</p>

<p>"Mr. Blunt, you as a third classman have
already received one hundred and forty-seven
demerits&mdash;I have looked up your record. As
a third classman you may receive in the year
two hundred and fifty demerits without being
unsatisfactory in conduct. For having civilian
clothes in possession you will receive
fifty demerits, and for having been absent
from academic limits, fifty more. That leaves
you only three to run on, but the end of the
year is at hand and you should be able to do
it. Further, I shall recommend that you be
deprived of your September leave. I am
sorry, Captain Blunt," he continued, "to punish
your son so severely, but if this had occurred
while you were commandant I don't
believe you would have been more lenient."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"His actions merit dismissal, Dalton; you
have been more than merciful," replied Captain
Blunt grimly. "But at the same time I
am glad that my son is not guilty of dishonorable
acts, and also that he is not to be dismissed.
But, Harry, clear up one more thing.
How did those things happen to be found in
your room?"</p>

<p>"Last night, father, I got to worrying about
that disguise and at about midnight I went to
the office and got them. I intended to take
them out in town to-day. Just as I got into
my room Mr. Drake came in and asked where
Mr. Stonewell was, and saw the coat, hat and
beard. Drake looked wild; I guess he didn't
have much sleep last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough, Harry; you're getting a bit
too loquacious," interrupted the young man's
father.</p>

<p>During all of this talk Stonewell and Robert
were both silent and yet rapt listeners.
Not one word had they exchanged, but at
times Stonewell regarded Robert with an expression
of deep affection, full of concern.
And Robert was so full of self-disgust and
shame that he dared not look either his room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>mate
or Captain Blunt in the face. He felt
that his own action had been simply ridiculous;
that instead of heroism he had been
guilty of foolishness.</p>

<p>"Now, Dalton," remarked Captain Blunt,
and his face assumed a look of intense earnestness
and feeling, "everything has come out
well for Mr. Stonewell and for my son. I hope
you will pardon me for speaking for Mr.
Drake. I realize, of course, his offense; and I
know that for this offense you will be justified
in inflicting any punishment up to dismissal.
I am of course aware of your duties
as commandant, of the imperative necessity
that discipline must be maintained. And I
agree that he has committed a most serious
offense. But, Dalton," and here Captain
Blunt's voice, rugged veteran though he was,
broke with emotion, and in husky tones he
continued, "Dalton, Mr. Drake's offense arose
from sentiments that do credit to his heart&mdash;his
idea was to spare me from sorrow&mdash;and he
could not force himself to testify against his
roommate. Dalton, is this not a case for
mercy? He not only tried to save my boy for
my sake, but three years ago he saved my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
life. Dalton&mdash;I make a personal plea for
mercy."</p>

<p>Commander Dalton's eyes were shining very
bright. He looked at Robert with an expression
that caused him to feel that at least his
judge was sympathetic.</p>

<p>"Mr. Drake," he began, "if a midshipman
persists in disobedience to the commandant's
orders, if he persists in refusing to answer the
commandant's questions, he must be dismissed;
no other action is possible. You have been
asked certain questions which you have not yet
answered; and by now you have had plenty of
time to decide your answers. I will repeat
my questions. Did you last night detect
Cadet Commander Stonewell in an attempt to
steal an examination?"</p>

<p>"Sir?" gasped Robert, a flood of joy surging
through him.</p>

<p>"Did you, Mr. Drake?"</p>

<p>"I thought I did, sir, but I was mistaken;
I know now it was his brother, Frank Stonewell,"
stammered Robert, realizing the purport
of the commandant's question, yet hardly
able to answer through sheer happiness.</p>

<p>"Did you, Mr. Drake, detect Mr. Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Blunt in an attempt to steal an examination
last night?"</p>

<p>"I thought I did, sir, but I was mistaken.
I know now it was Midshipman Bligh whom
I saw."</p>

<p>Commander Dalton smiled happily. "I
think this disposes of Mr. Drake's case," he
remarked. "Now, Mr. Blunt, my advice to
you is to walk a chalk mark the rest of your
time here. Mr. Stonewell, I am sure you will
forgive my words. I was mistaken, of course,
and was under great feeling. You can hardly
be happier over the final outcome than I am.
I will turn your brother's case over to you to
handle; he is beyond me. I can but say I
envy you the friend you possess. Evidently
Mr. Drake would sacrifice his career rather
than contribute to his friend's disgrace. And
yet he could not lie, even to save that friend.
Gentlemen, we've had a hard morning, and
deep feelings have been stirred. I think this
is all. Captain Blunt, are you ready to leave?"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="center">"BLIGH, BLIGH, BLIGH!"</p>


<p>That Sunday afternoon the Naval Academy
was in an uproar, for the complete history of
Harry Blunt's disguise had become known to
all midshipmen, and every one of them was
fascinated and intensely amused at his daring.</p>

<p>It was not the commandant's intention that
the facts should become generally known.
But Harry Blunt never yet had been very
amenable to orders. First he told two or
three intimates under strict injunctions of
secrecy, and each of these told three or four
of their close friends in confidence; and in
this strictly confidential way the history of
Harry Blunt's disguise became known before
dinner was over to every midshipman of the
brigade.</p>

<p>Now the stern officers who inculcate discipline
and a few other things on the minds
and character of midshipmen know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
these young gentlemen should have been
pained and grieved to learn that one of their
number had left a disguise in the office of the
dreaded officer-in-charge of the first division
of midshipmen; in that office where demerits
were assigned and daily preachments were
solemnly made to erring midshipmen. And
we know they should have been dismayed that
yet another one had proposed three groans for
the highest authorities at the Naval Academy.
But to be candid one is compelled to admit
that the midshipmen's sentiments on these
matters were far otherwise.</p>

<p>Indeed, the fact is Bligh's audacity thrilled
and fascinated every midshipman of the
brigade. It came as a violent shock; and
after the thrill came amazement, and then uproarious
laughter.</p>

<p>That a midshipman should have kept
civilian clothes for months right under the
nose of an austere lieutenant-commander
touched the brigade's "funny bone."</p>

<p>It was felt that Harry Blunt had a good
joke on that lieutenant-commander. Toward
Bligh there suddenly developed great admiration.
His proposing groans for the superin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>tendent
and the commandant was the most
audacious thing that had happened in the
memory of any midshipman then at Annapolis.
And his frank assumption of the guilt
of the acts charged against Third Classman
Blunt, a man with whom he had been on the
worst of terms, suddenly awoke all midshipmen
to a belief that the despised Bligh had
not merited the obloquy so universally cast
upon him.</p>

<p>"Poor beggar," remarked Glassfell to
Farnum, "he was only a plebe, and hadn't
yet been educated up to the niceties of honor.
He was only trying to save himself from bilging;
and he hasn't been treated decently here,
that's a fact. But what unparalleled nerve!
Goodness! The idea of his standing up and
shouting out those groans! Well, I think a
good many of us have groaned more than
once at the superintendent and commandant!"
and Glassfell chuckled.</p>

<p>When Harry Blunt left the commandant's
office that Sunday morning he went straight
to Bligh's room.</p>

<p>"Bligh," he cried, "you are white, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
jingo! everybody in this Academy is going to
know it before night. I've treated you badly,
Bligh, right from the start; and when I think
of what you did this morning&mdash;well, I'm
ashamed of myself, that's how I feel. Look
here, Bligh, would you shake hands?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that, Blunt?" exclaimed
Bligh, joyfully, his face aglow with happiness.</p>

<p>"Mean it? I'm proud to be your friend if
you will only let me!" and these two young
men who had so long cherished bitter feelings
against each other jumped into a warm, generous
friendship.</p>

<p>With the tale of Bligh's audacity went
everywhere the story of how he had saved
Blunt. And midshipmen were touched deeply
in suddenly realizing the sad, lonely, ostracized
life Bligh had led; of the generosity of
conduct by one so universally despised. And
thus there was a reaction by leaps and bounds
of generous feeling toward that once unhappiest
of young men.</p>

<p>Bligh's character was hardly changed in
these few days; the strongest thing in it was
still a desire for applause, and he fairly drank
in the kindly words that were now profusely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
showered upon him. The direct effect was to
make him tremendously happy; Bligh really
had never been hopelessly vicious, unwarrantable
as had been some of his acts. And no
midshipman had ever lived a sadder life at
the Naval Academy. And the sudden change
from ostracism to popularity overwhelmed
him with happiness and filled him with ambition
to merit the kindly feelings that went
with him in his final days at Annapolis.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday Bligh received
an official letter from the Secretary of
the Navy with the curt information that his
resignation as midshipman had been accepted,
and so the fear of disgraceful dismissal
vanished. He was to reënter civil life without
the stigma of expulsion from the naval
service. He was all packed up and left on
the afternoon train.</p>

<p>Beside him in the car sat Frank Stonewell.</p>

<p>"Stonewell," remarked Bligh, "you will
never know the good you've done me; you
came to me with your friendship when I had
no friend and when I needed one badly. I was
going to the dogs and hated everybody; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
helped to restore my self-respect and gave me
a hope I might be of some account after all.
I'm going to try to live right from now on,
to make a point of deserving friends."</p>

<p>"You're all right, Harry," replied Frank
Stonewell; "you just needed to get a good
grip on yourself; you had the academic regulations
and standards on the brain when I
first met you; you were actually morbid
about them. Perhaps I pushed my defiance
of them a little too far when I played the last
trick, but I love to dare. However, it's all a
phase of life. But, I say, Bligh, look out
there! What are all those midshipmen running
into the station for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Blunt and a lot of third and
fourth classmen. I guess they had a late
dress parade and are trying to get to this
train to bid somebody good-bye. Probably
some girl is aboard whom they all like."</p>

<p>"All aboard!" shouted the conductor.</p>

<p>Then came a sharp cry in staccato words,
from the well-known voice of Harry Blunt.
"Four N yell, fellows," he cried, just before
the train started.</p>

<p>And then from over a hundred throats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
came a well-known Naval Academy shout, as
follows:</p>

<p class="center">
"N N N N<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A A A A</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">V V V V</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Y Y Y Y</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Navy&mdash;</span><br />
Bligh, Bligh, Bligh."
</p>

<p>It was in this way, and with this shout
tingling in his ears, that Bligh left Annapolis.
His eyes glistened. A mist swam before
them. A moment later he turned to his
companion and said: "Frank, I've heard
that same call before&mdash;but I'd given up all
hope of ever hearing it again&mdash;I can't tell
you what it means to me&mdash;but it seems as if
those good chaps have forgotten scores of
mean things and have remembered the one
decent thing I did at Annapolis."</p>

<p>Three years later a recent Princeton graduate
was speaking at Annapolis with Cadet
Lieutenant Sexton.</p>

<p>"Tell me about Bligh," inquired Sexton.
"I've heard you chaps at Princeton liked
him there. He was here for a while, in fact
was my roommate&mdash;he had a hard time at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
first, but everybody here liked him when he
left."</p>

<p>"Liked him!" exclaimed the Princeton
man. "I guess we did; we more than liked
him. Harry Bligh was one of the squarest
fellows that ever lived, and one of the kindest
and best besides. We were proud of his football
record, of course&mdash;he was probably the
best half-back in the country last season.
But he was lots more than that. He was a
helpful friend to all of us. I remember he
once pulled me out of a deep hole; and I
wasn't the only one. Just let a fellow get
into trouble and before long you'd find Bligh
helping him out. Bligh could never be
turned against any one. I remember one of
our fellows did something off color; he
offended our class feeling; well, we were going
to do something&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;but
Bligh sort of took charge of affairs and
said: 'Let's not condemn that fellow; we may
only succeed in shoving him deeper into the
pit he is in; let's see if we can't find some good
in him, or point him right, anyway.' Well,
we did, and we were mighty glad of it afterward.
He was always helping a fellow that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
needed a friend. I once said to him, 'Harry,
what is your ambition?' He seemed to think
quite a while and then said: 'I want to be
square, and I want people to believe I am
square.' And you just bet, Sexton, that a
bullier, squarer chap than Harry Bligh never
lived."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="center">THE END OF A LONG DAY</p>


<p>"Stone, will you ever forgive me?" asked
Robert shamefacedly, as soon as they had left
the commandant's office.</p>

<p>"Forgive you, Bob? Never speak of such
a thing! Forgive you for sacrificing yourself
for me? Bob, I can hardly talk about it,"
and Stonewell felt such a rush of feeling come
over him at the memory of what Robert was
willing to do for him, and of his own affection
for his friend, that it was necessary for him to
control himself before he could continue.
"Bob," he finally said, "the whole thing was
my fault. I should have told you about
Frank. You are not a bit to blame for thinking
you saw me last night. Well, Bob, there's
no use in my thanking you for your attitude
toward me&mdash;such actions are away beyond
thanks. It's hard to talk these things over,
but I want you to believe one thing. I'll
never forget what you've done for me&mdash;never.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Bob, I don't suppose the time will ever come
when I will have occasion to show my appreciation&mdash;I
don't want it to come, for that
would mean misfortune&mdash;and I don't imagine
I could possibly show the greatness of soul
you have. But don't you ever look up to me
again. I may work out probs a bit faster than
you do, but for greatness of character, for
everything that goes to make up leadership,
you are the man of the class, not I. Why,
when I think of you I positively feel small."</p>

<p>Robert laughed happily. "Oh, Stone," he
said, "don't talk foolishness. The whole
thing seems like a dream to me now. I was
in the most mixed up state imaginable. I
just saw you do it; that's the way I felt. I
knew it was you, and yet I could not realize
how it could be you. I thought that for some
unexplainable reason you had determined to
help Blunt. But why should you help Blunt?
The whole thing was wholly beyond my comprehension;
and yet I thought I saw you do
it. Well, it's all right now, thank goodness.
But what a remarkable resemblance your
brother has to you; not only in features but
also in voice."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so; still, such resemblances
frequently exist. There is a rear admiral in
our navy that had a son here and another at
West Point at the same time. On one occasion
when these two chaps were at home together,
they exchanged uniforms and even the old
gentleman himself was completely fooled.
But I'm going to tell you about Frank. He
has been at several schools and colleges and
has repeatedly been dismissed. Some time
ago he was expelled from Princeton and came
down here. You see he's afraid of my father
and leans somewhat on me. I was intensely
disgusted. He was mixed up in a scrape in
which some unpopular professor was left over
night tied up in a room. Now as a matter of
fact Frank for once had no part in this outrage.
But he was suspected and accused&mdash;it's
a long story; I won't go into that, Bob. He
denied it, but was not believed, and was dismissed;
if he were not guilty it was evident
he knew who the guilty parties were, and he
refused to divulge their names. So he came
to Annapolis, and for this thing to occur just
before our graduation was extremely unpleasant
to me. I just couldn't talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
him, but I used to go out to see him. A short
time ago the whole truth came out, and Frank
was exonerated, and then to my surprise he
refused to return to Princeton. He had no
good reason, but now I can see that he had become
interested in Bligh. He was stubborn
about not going back, and this surprised me.
He never spoke of Bligh; probably the latter
had asked him not to. Finally he demanded
an apology from somebody in Princeton who
had accused him of falsehood, and I went up
to see what could be done. But the whole
thing, including Frank's stubbornness, was so
distasteful to me that I never spoke of it even
to you."</p>

<p>"Gracious, if you'd only told me, Stone;&mdash;I
hope he'll have no more trouble. But did
you fix matters at Princeton for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but his skirts were not entirely clean
and he'll have to repeat his year. I imagine
he'll take Bligh back with him&mdash;those two
have struck up a great friendship."</p>

<p>"Stone, I'm going to see young Blunt, and
apologize to him."</p>

<p>"What for? You've never said a word
about him to anybody."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but I've thought a lot. Come along."</p>

<p>"Blunt," said Robert later in the latter's
room, "I apologize to you for imagining you
did things which you didn't do."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother your apology, Drake. But, by
George, I want to tell you you are a regular
brick. You've a pile of nerve and are all sorts
of a good fellow. And isn't that chap Bligh a
trump? Just to think of his using my cit
suit, and his groaning for the supe. Say,
that's the best thing that has ever happened
at the Naval Academy," and Blunt burst into
a peal of infectious laughter.</p>

<p>After they left Harry, Stonewell said:
"Now, Bob, we are going to call on Captain
Blunt."</p>

<p>"I can't, Stone&mdash;you have no notion how
awkward I feel."</p>

<p>"Of course you do, but you've got to get
over that feeling, and it will only last a moment."</p>

<p>But Robert didn't feel awkward at all; he
had no chance to. He was received by Mrs.
Blunt with a loving cordiality that put him
entirely at his ease. And Helen's manner
was as bright and natural as usual. Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Blunt said but little, but that little seemed to
say, in addition to the words he spoke: "I
approve of this young man; he will be an
honor to the cloth." The fact that Robert
had acted under a misapprehension was not
considered. The intent that animated him
was what influenced their feelings.</p>

<p>Nellie Strong, who was visiting with the
Blunts, as usual was tremendously interested
in all that happened. "I just knew something
was to occur to you, Robert Drake,"
she exclaimed. "I never feel safe when you
are around. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if
a terrible Turk were to burst in upon us this
minute and carry you off. You're positively
dangerous to have around."</p>

<p>"Nellie, I hear you are to lead our class
german with Stonewell," was Robert's smiling
reply.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm just delighted over it. Helen
Blunt thinks she's the most important girl in
town because she's going to present the flag to
your company; and I'm awfully glad she is,
Robert; it's just fine. But I'd much rather
lead the german with Mr. Stonewell. Helen's
glory will last only five minutes&mdash;and mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
will last for hours. What in the world are
you yawning for, Robert Drake? Don't you
find my conversation interesting enough to
keep you awake? One would imagine you
hadn't had many winks of sleep last night."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Nellie," he said. "To
tell you the truth now that I come to think of
it, I don't think I had even one wink last
night."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="center">GRADUATION</p>


<p>The annual examinations commenced the
next morning and lasted throughout the week.
It was a time of apprehension to some, of exultation
to others, and of tremendous interest
to all; for these examinations, averaged in
with the previous records made in daily recitations
and monthly examinations, were to
determine the class rank of each midshipman.
The examinations were written; they began
at eight o'clock each morning and lasted till
one. In the afternoons hundreds of midshipmen
were to be seen streaming through the
pleasant grounds of the Naval Academy, many
of them accompanied by pretty girls who
seemed to think that the institution's chief
purpose was to provide them with pleasant
times. For though the examinations took
all of the mornings, in the afternoons were
teas, launch parties and impromptu dances.
And happy were the midshipmen who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
without fear of failure, and so could afford
these social pleasures. There were other midshipmen
who, not so fortunate, with puckered
brows and worried faces, feverishly worked at
their books, and among these was Harry
Blunt.</p>

<p>The week passed quickly, and at its close
Robert Drake knew he would graduate fifth
in his class. That Stonewell would graduate
first had long been a foregone conclusion. The
Blunt family were now out of suspense and
knew that Harry had passed, his application
to his studies in these last days being well rewarded.</p>

<p>Graduation week came, and with it the
Annual Board of Visitors, who are supposed
to make a serious investigation of the Naval
Academy in all of its parts. And for one
week the midshipmen are required to show off
their various accomplishments.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the midshipmen as
a brigade of infantry passed in review before
the Board of Visitors, and Robert Drake, commanding
the first company, felt proud indeed
as he snapped out the order, just before he
reached the reviewing stand, of:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>"First company&mdash;eyes right!"</p>

<p>After dismissal the midshipmen rushed into
their working clothes and dispersed into
different shops, and great was the hammering
in the blacksmith and boiler shops as the
Board marched through. In this week of
each year the Naval Academy is on official
exhibition for this wise Board. And for
its benefit sham battles are fought, young
men scramble aloft on antiquated sailing
ships and feverishly loose and make sail,
haul on buntlines, clewlines, sheets and braces.
They are mustered in the different class rooms
and the Board sees them at the blackboard,
pointer in hand, in the act of explaining an
intricate valve motion to an earnest lieutenant.
What the Board does not see is the alacrity
with which pointer, blackboard and room are
abandoned as soon as the Board has passed on.</p>

<p>So this week there were, as there always is
at graduation time, sample machine shop
drills, gunnery drills, electrical drills, steam
engine drills&mdash;and many others. And the
tired, earnest, hard-working Board was
marched through it all at a lively pace. This
Board was composed of statesmen, professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
men, and business men of established reputation;
but it is not certain that any of them
knew the difference between a Stephenson
link of an engine and the club link of an
anchor chain. However, they worked hard
and wrote a voluminous report of fifty printed
pages, which, covered with dust, is lying with
fifty other similar reports in a pigeonhole at
the Navy Department.</p>

<p>On Wednesday occurred the great day for
Helen Blunt. At ten in the morning she
was in the receiving stand gowned beautifully
in simple white, and carrying a huge bunch
of American Beauty roses.</p>

<p>Soon martial music was heard, and then the
brigade of midshipmen was to be seen across
the parade ground, marching with its precise
military stride. Then loud vibrating orders
were carried to the ears of ten thousand spectators
and bugles rang out their harsh notes.
In exact unison the seven hundred midshipmen,
who had been in column of squads,
wheeled into line, and marched steadily to
the front until they were within a hundred
paces of the reviewing stand, where they
halted. In the centre of the long line were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the colors, unfolded and waving to the
breeze.</p>

<p>"Color guard to the front," was the vibrant
order from Cadet Commander Stonewell.</p>

<p>"First company to the front and centre,"
followed immediately.</p>

<p>The old color guard with the colors
marched slowly to the front, and on the
right of the line some quick, jerky orders
were heard, and the first company broke from
the line and came marching toward the centre
of the brigade.</p>

<p>Thousands of spectators now saw a pretty
ceremony. A young girl stepped from the
receiving stand and advanced toward the
waiting color guard; the Academy colors
were handed to her, and the ex-color guard
was then marched off.</p>

<p>Helen did not remain alone for many moments,
but for an instant a pretty picture was
presented on the drill grounds. A beautiful
girl, carrying in one arm a huge bunch of red
roses, and in the other steadying the glorious
colors of the Naval Academy, standing alone,
facing seven hundred blue-coated statues.
But in a moment another color guard approached,
the color guard of the company
judged to have won the flag. And with it
marched the captain of the company, Cadet
Lieutenant Drake.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/i006.png" width="456" height="700" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>IT MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY
PRETTY SPEECH</i></span></span>
</div>

<p>The new color guard halted a few feet in
front of Helen, and then Robert stepped forward.</p>

<p>The air was very still save for the robins
chirping to their young. An absolute hush
fell over the many thousand spectators. It
was evident that the young lady was presenting
the flag, and was making a speech to the
captain of the winning company. But so far
away she was, and so softly she spoke, that
none heard her words; that is, none save
Robert Drake and the new color guard. But
people said it must have been a very pretty
speech. After apparently saying a few words,
Helen seemed suddenly to pick up the
colors and fairly throw them into the hands
of Cadet Lieutenant Drake.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that pretty?" was an exclamation
made by many of the onlookers.</p>

<p>"You have done very well, Mr. Drake,"
faltered Helen; "your company has done
splendidly. Oh&mdash;I had a good speech made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a><br /><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
up, but I've forgotten all about it! Father
wants you to come to dinner to-night&mdash;he has
a surprise for you&mdash;oh, dear, what am I talking
about? Won't this do? Haven't I said
enough?&mdash;Oh, take the flag!" and Helen
threw it at Robert.</p>

<p>The next day the papers said that Miss
Helen Blunt had made an eloquent little
speech of well chosen words when presenting
the colors to Cadet Lieutenant Drake, but of
that one may judge for himself.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Robert, simply and
gravely, taking the colors and handing them
to his color sergeant; "the first company is
honored."</p>

<p>And then Stonewell, in clear ringing tones
shouted:</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the girl who has presented
the colors."</p>

<p>"Hurrah&mdash;hurrah&mdash;hurrah!" rang out in
perfect unison from over seven hundred young
throats.</p>

<p>Then Cadet Lieutenant Sam Blair stepped
to the front and proposed, "Three cheers for
the winning company, and its cadet lieutenant,"
which were heartily given.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the surprise, Helen?" asked
Robert that evening at seven o'clock as he
entered the Blunt house.</p>

<p>"I won't tell you; you must find out for
yourself," replied Helen happily; "come into
the drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;father&mdash;oh, what a happy surprise,"
cried Robert a moment later. "Captain
Blunt, you have had my mother and
father come to my graduation!" Indeed
Robert could hardly speak for sheer joy.</p>

<p>"Yes, Robert," said Mr. Drake, "Captain
Blunt has asked us to visit him for your last
days, and here we are; we thought to give
you a happy surprise."</p>

<p>It had been many years since Mr. Drake
had visited Annapolis. He vividly recalled
his own midshipman days, the joyful strife
and the friendly rivalry. These had long
passed, but he found classmates and many
old navy friends with whom to renew old
scenes and almost forgotten times.</p>

<p>The first class german took place that night
in the Armory, and only first classmen and
their chosen partners went on the floor.
These midshipmen had donned for the occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>sion
their new white officer uniforms, and the
young ladies all wore pure white dresses with
ribbons of old gold. Stonewell led, and with
him, radiant with happiness, was Nellie Strong.
The first classmen, seventy in number, were
all present.</p>

<p>On the balcony overhead were thousands
of visitors enjoying the pretty, novel figures
made by the handsome couples on the floor
below.</p>

<p>The next night the evening promenade concert
occurred. The grounds were made bright
with numbers of lighted Japanese lanterns
hung among the trees. The Naval Academy
band played beautifully, and Robert, walking
between his father and mother, followed the
crowd of happy promenaders, talking of his
four years within the Academy walls, of the
difficulties he had had, and of the friends and
good fortune that had come to him.</p>

<p>And the following day was Robert's graduation.</p>

<p>The brigade was formed with the band on
the right; next came the first classmen about
to be graduated, without arms. Then came
the brigade, with rifles, the temporarily ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>pointed
cadet officers of the second class wearing
swords. Soon the brigade marched off
with slow measured tread to the chapel, the
band playing all the way that tune, full of
joy to midshipmen's ears, of: "Ain't I glad
to get out of the wilderness?" It finally had
a special meaning to the young men about to
receive their diplomas. In the chapel the
chaplain, dear to generations of midshipmen,
made an eloquent, heartfelt prayer, and then
the superintendent delivered a short address.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen," he began, "your lives
in the navy are now to begin in earnest. You
have been here for four years, surrounded by
a naval atmosphere, and drilled in those
things required of our naval officers. From
now on your work will be on familiar lines,
but yet there will be a great difference. Here,
at the Naval Academy, if you make a mistake
in your navigation work, you will receive a
low mark. Aboard ship you will do the same
exact kind of navigation, but if you make a
mistake you may cause a ship and hundreds
of lives to be lost. The great difference is that
in the outside naval service you are at all
times under great responsibilities; here your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
responsibilities have been but slight. Here, if
you drill well, your company may win the
Academy colors, and that is what many of you
have worked for. Aboard ship, if the enlisted
men under you do not drill well, it will be
your fault, and it will mean your men do not
shoot accurately, that your engines are inefficient,
that your ship is neither an honor
to the flag, nor could an admiral depend upon
it in battle when the interests of your country
were at stake.</p>

<p>"Here you have been under instruction.
You have for long years been drilled in the
duties of the private in the ranks, of the fireman
at the furnace, of the machinist at the
lathe, of the electrician at the switchboard, of
the gun pointer in the turret, of the helmsman
at the wheel&mdash;there is no duty that an
enlisted man can be called upon to do aboard
ship that you have not been drilled in at this
institution. But, besides this, you have
designed steam and electric engines, and built
them with your own hands in the shops; you
have gone deeply into the mathematics of
natural law and can not only operate a
machine, but you can design it and build it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gentlemen, you have been under a most
expensive instruction here, for which, as yet,
you have rendered no return.</p>

<p>"You are now splendidly equipped for your
life-work in the navy. You will find that
aboard ship your principal duties will be the
instruction of enlisted men. You were
gathered here, not only that you personally
might become accomplished officers, but that
you might receive instruction for the purpose
of imparting it to others. You must prove
that the earnest efforts spent upon you have
not been wasted. You must apply full benefit
of the training you have here received to
the enlisted men who will soon be in your
charge, or else the purpose of this institution
has failed.</p>

<p>"We expect to hear good reports of you; we
are proud of you, but we will know our confidence
in you is not misplaced when we hear
that your guns shoot straight, your engines
steam well, and that the enlisted men under
you are contented and believe in you. When
we hear that we will be content, for we will
know our work here has produced results.</p>

<p>"For a last word, never forget the glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
record made by our navy in every war; and
may it enter your hearts that you all have a
special duty to do your utmost to keep bright
our naval history."</p>

<p>As the superintendent sat down the choir
sang:</p>

<p>
"God be with you till we meet again."<br />
</p>

<p>The midshipmen were now marched out and
formed a line near the band stand, the graduating
class in front of the brigade, who stood
at "Order arms." The superintendent and
other officials proceeded to the band stand; the
superintendent studied his watch anxiously.
"He should be here now," he remarked.
"Ah, there is the carriage." The carriage he
looked for stopped on the walk in front of the
band stand, and Robert Drake's heart thumped
when he saw who got out of it.</p>

<p>A rather thick-set, not overtall, fair complexioned
gentleman jumped out of the carriage.
Everybody about glanced with much
interest at him, and all hats came off.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help being late; I had much to
do this morning," remarked the gentleman;
"did you receive my telegram, admiral?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. President, and we went right
ahead," replied the superintendent; "but you
are in time to give out the diplomas."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>Stonewell's name was the first called out to
come up for his diploma. A storm of applause
broke forth from his classmates and
friends as this erect, manly young officer approached
the President. Cheer after cheer
greeted him, for by this time Stonewell was appreciated
outside as well as inside of the
Academy.</p>

<p>The President shook Stonewell's hand
warmly and handed him his diploma with a
smile, saying, "We all know you, Mr. Stonewell;
I feel like joining in that cheer myself."</p>

<p>Farnum came up next, then Sewall, then
Ryerson, and all received generous cheers.
Then the name Drake was called. Tumultuous
shouts and applause now broke loose.
Robert was liked and respected by the entire
brigade, but as the captain of the winning
company in the flag competition he had
sixty devoted champions in ranks who were
not willing that any graduating midshipman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
should receive more applause than their own
popular cadet lieutenant.</p>

<p>Robert's father and mother in front seats
were filled with happy pride that their son
should graduate so high in his class, and with
such vociferous evidence of warm regard.
And then a strange thing happened, a little
incident that overwhelmed not only Mr. and
Mrs. Drake with amazement, but also thousands
of spectators.</p>

<p>When the name Drake was called, the most
famous man in the world of his day left the
platform where he had been standing, and
rapidly approached Robert, meeting him half
way. He greeted him warmly, and said:
"Mr. Drake, one of the reasons that induced
me to come to Annapolis to-day was to have
the pleasure of personally handing you your
diploma. The superintendent has told me
your father and mother are present. Are they
close at hand?"</p>

<p>"Just in front, sir."</p>

<p>"Present me, please."</p>

<p>The President said to them, "Mr. and Mrs.
Drake, I am delighted to meet you. I congratulate
you on your son. I am proud of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
him. A year ago at this time he rendered
signal service to his country."</p>

<p>In this way the President of the United
States showed that his formerly expressed appreciation
had not been lightly forgotten, and
thus he publicly performed an act of kindly
recognition.</p>

<p>That their son should be so wonderfully
honored filled Robert's father and mother
with a deep happiness that outweighed all
other thoughts, and they were much affected
by the President's attention.</p>

<p>One by one the remaining members of the
graduating class received their diplomas and
a hearty handshake from the President; and
soon the graduation was over.</p>

<p>But one more scene occurred in Robert's
life as a midshipman at Annapolis. That
night the much talked of graduating ball,
given to his class, was held. The great Armory
was beautifully decorated with flowers and
plants, and in between and overhead were
flags and bunting tastefully arranged. And
on the floor were beautiful girls and manly
young men.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has been a wonderful life to me, Helen,"
said Robert to his partner; "as I look back it
seems that I never lived until I entered Annapolis.
I've had glorious times; my life has
been full of hard work, but the results give
me intense satisfaction. And besides the
work, there has been almost complete contentment;
it is so satisfactory to work hard
and work successfully. And in addition to
all this are the friendships that have come to
me, that of you, and your family, Stonewell
and others."</p>

<p>"Yes, Robert," replied Helen wistfully, with
half a sigh; "all this is so, but to-morrow you
are to leave us for those dreadful Philippine
Islands, and how we shall all miss you! That
is the sad thing about naval friendships; we
enjoy them daily and deeply for a short time
and then suddenly our dear friends are torn
from us and we do not see them for years.
And then&mdash;oh, then things are changed and
nothing ever seems so happy and bright as it
once was," and Helen's voice trembled and
her eyes filled as she thought these happy days
could not continue.</p>

<p>"Helen, you will let me write to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
won't you? And you will answer my letters?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Helen sadly.</p>

<p>"And, Helen, I am coming back to you,
just as I am now; nothing can change the
thoughts that are part of me."</p>

<p>Helen suddenly looked at Robert and a
glorified beauty shone from her eyes. They
walked slowly around the Armory satisfied
just to be with each other. And a beautiful
content rested upon them.</p>
